We studied the impact of reporting delay and reporting error on incidence rates and trends for cancers of the female breast, colorectal, lung/bronchus, prostate, and melanoma. Methods: Based on statistical models, we obtained reporting-adjusted (i.e., adjusted for both reporting delay and reporting error) case counts for each diagnosis year beginning in 1981 using reporting information for patients diagnosed with cancer in 1981-1998 from nine cancer registries that participate in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. Joinpoint linear regression was used for trend analysis. All statistical tests are two-sided. Results: Initial incidence case counts (i.e., after the standard 2-year delay) accounted for only 88%-97% of the estimated final counts; it would take 4-17 years for 99% or more of the cancer cases to be reported. The percent change between reporting-adjusted and unadjusted cancer incidence rates for the 1998 diagnosis year ranged from 3% for colorectal cancers to 14% for melanoma in whites and for prostate cancer in black males. Reporting-adjusted current incidence trends for breast cancer and lung/bronchus cancer in white females showed statistically significant increases (estimated annual percent change [EAPC] = 0.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.1% to 1.2%) and 1.2%, 95% CI = 0.7% to 1.6%, respectively), whereas trends for these cancers using unadjusted incidence rates were not statistically significantly different from zero (EAPC = 0.4%, 95% CI = -0.1% to 0.9% and 0.5%, 95% CI = -0.1% to 1.1%, respectively). Reporting-adjusted melanoma incidence rates for white males showed a statistically significant increase since 1981 (EAPC = 4.1%, 95% CI = 3.8% to 4.4%) in contrast to the unadjusted incidence rate, which was most consistent with a flat or downward trend (EAPC = -4.2%, 95% CI = -11.1% to 3.3%) after 1996. Conclusions: Reporting-adjusted cancer incidence rates are valuable in precisely determining current cancer incidence rates and trends and in monitoring the timeliness of data collection. Ignoring reporting delay and reporting error may produce downwardly biased cancer incidence trends, particularly in the most recent diagnosis years."

We hypothesized that hyperthermia would be associated with a worsened cognitive outcome after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). Methods - Three hundred consenting patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass for CABG had hourly postoperative temperatures recorded. The degree of postoperative hyperthermia was determined by using the maximum temperature within the first 24 hours as well as by calculating the area under the curve for temperatures >37°C. Patients underwent a battery of cognitive testing both before surgery and 6 weeks after surgery. By use of factor analysis, 4 cognitive domains (scores) were identified, and the mean of the 4 scores was used to calculate the cognitive index (CI). Cognitive change was calculated as the 6-week CI minus the baseline CI. Multivariable linear regression (controlling for age, baseline cognitive function, and temperature during cardiopulmonary bypass) was used to compare postoperative hyperthermia with the postoperative cognitive change. Results - The maximum temperature within the first 24 hours after CABG ranged from 37.2°C to 39.3°C. There was no relationship between area under the curve for temperatures >37°C and cognitive dysfunction (P=0.45). However, the maximum postoperative temperature was associated with a greater amount of cognitive dysfunction at 6 weeks (P=0.05). Conclusions - This is the first report relating postoperative hyperthermia to cognitive dysfunction after cardiac surgery. Whether the hyperthermia caused the worsened outcome or whether processes that resulted in the worsened cognitive outcome also produced hyperthermia requires further investigation. In addition, interventions to avoid postoperative hyperthermia may be warranted to improve cerebral outcome after cardiac surgery."

This study investigated shift pattern (day shifts versus day-night rotation) and its interactions with age, and with years of shiftwork exposure, as predictors of body mass index (BMI). Methods. Survey data were collected from offshore personnel working day shifts (N=787) or day-night shifts (N=787); information was obtained about shift pattern and years of shiftwork exposure, height, weight, demographic factors, and smoking habits. Hierarchical multiple regression was used to test a model in which BMI was predicted by additive and interactive effects of shift pattern, age, and exposure years with control for confounding variables. Results. In a multivariate analysis (controlling for job type, education and smoking), BMI was predicted by the main effects of age and years of shiftwork exposure. Shift pattern was not significant as a main effect, but it interacted significantly with the curvilinear age term and with the linear and curvilinear components of shiftwork exposure. In the day shift group, age but not exposure predicted BMI; the opposite was true of the day-night shift group. The increase in BMI with an increase in age and exposure years was steeper for the day-night shift group than for the day shift group. Conclusions. The significant interaction effects found in this study were consistent with the view that continued exposure to day-night shift work gives rise to increases in BMI, over and above the normative effects of ageing on BMI shown by day-shift workers."

The estimation uses a new instrumental variable (IV) method that measures program impacts on quantiles. The quantile treatment effects (QTE) estimator reduces to quantile regression when selection for treatment is oxogenously determined. QTE can be computed as the solution to a convex linear programming problem, although this requires first-step estimation of a nuisance function. We develop distribution theory for the case where the first step is estimated nonparametrically. For women, the empirical results show that the JTPA program had the largest proportional impact at low quantiles. Perhaps surprisingly, however, JTPA training raised the quantiles of earnings for men only in the upper half of the trainee earnings distribution."

Anti-V3 antibodies (Abs) recognize both types of elements, but Abs which preferentially react to the conformational aspect of the epitopes may have more potent neutralizing activity against HIV-1, as recently suggested. To test this hypothesis, human anti-V3 monoclonal Abs (MAbs) were selected using a V3 fusion protein (V3-FP) which retains the conformation of the third variable region. The V3-FP consists of the V3JR-CSF sequence inserted into a truncated form of murine leukemia virus gp70. Six human MAbs which recognize epitopes at the crown of the V3 loop were selected with the V3-FP. They were found to react more strongly with molecules displaying conformationally intact V3 than with linear V3 peptides. In a virus capture assay, these MAbs showed cross-clade binding to native, intact virions of clades A, B, C, D, and F. No binding was found to isolates from subtype E. The neutralizing activity of MAbs against primary isolates was determined in three assays: the GHOST cell assay, a phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cell assay, and a luciferase assay. While these new MAbs displayed various degrees of activity, the pattern of cross-clade neutralization of clades A, B, and F was most pronounced. The neutralization of clades C and D viruses was weak and sporadic, and neutralization of clade E by these MAbs was not detected. Analysis by linear regression showed a highly significant correlation (P < 0.0001) between the strength of binding of these anti-V3 MAbs to intact virions and the percent neutralization. These studies demonstrate that human MAbs to conformation-sensitive epitopes of V3 display cross-clade reactivity in both binding to native, intact virions and neutralization of primary isolates."

Eight subjects completed 8 weeks (4 days per week) of resistance training which consisted of unilateral plantar flexion at 70% of one repetition maximum with 10 repetitions per set (5 sets per day). They performed resistance training (RT) on one side and resistance training and static stretching training (RST; 10 min per day, 7 days per week) on the other side. Before and after training, the elongation of the tendon structures in the medial gastrocnemius muscle was directly measured using ultrasonography, while the subjects performed ramp isometric plantar flexion up to the voluntary maximum, followed by a ramp relaxation. The relationship between estimated muscle force (Fm) and tendon elongation (L) was fitted to a linear regression, the slope of which was defined as stiffness. The hysteresis was calculated as the ratio of the area within the Fm-L loop to the area beneath the load portion of the curve. The stiffness increased significantly by 18.8 ± 10.4% for RT and 15.3 ± 9.3% for RST. There was no significant difference in the relative increase of stiffness between RT and RST. The hysteresis, on the other hand, decreased 17 ± 20% for RST, but was unchanged for RT. These results suggested that the resistance training increased the stiffness of tendon structures as well as muscle strength and size, and the stretching training affected the viscosity of tendon structures but not the elasticity."

In a preliminary step, in order to define a regional rainfall index, a new form of extended principal component analysis is performed, aimed at capturing both the spatial and intraseasonal rainfall coherence. What emerges is that although the long rains exhibit a low temporal coherence, calling for a separation between the months of March-April and May in teleconnection studies, they show a relatively strong spatial consistency over the Kenya-Uganda inland region. From composite analyses performed using NCEP-NCAR reanalyzed atmospheric data, three major signals appear for that region. Two are during March-April involving ENSO and the latitudinal location of the ITCZ, and ENSO interactions with the northern extratropical dynamics (by way of cool surges toward the Tropics and upper-ridge-trough systems). The third signal is the Asian monsoon in May. As shown using a rainfall index for Ethiopia, the interactions with the midlatitudes get stronger when considering rainfall farther to the north. The predictability study identifies four February indexes, involving several scales and several atmospheric and oceanic parameters, to serve as predictors in linear multiple regression (LMR) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) models. The predictors, selected by a stepwise procedure, depict both regional (energy gradient and zonal wind) and remote dynamics (ENSO and 500-hPa geopotential height over the Near East): they are consistent with the signals shown in the synchronous composites. The robustness of the LMR and LDA models is demonstrated by the high linear error in probability space (LEPS) scores (44% for continuous variables and 51% for categorical variables) obtained on cross-validated results."

Residuals from linear regressions are used frequently in statistical analysis, often for the purpose of controlling for unwanted effects in multivariable datasets. This paper criticizes the practice, building upon recent critiques. 2. Regression of residuals is often used as an alternative to multiple regression, often with the aim of controlling for confounding variables. When correlations exist between independent variables, as is generally the case with ecological datasets, this procedure leads to biased parameter estimates. Standard multiple regression, by contrast, yields unbiased parameter estimates. 3. In multiple regression parameters are estimated controlling for the effects of the other variables in the model, and thus multiple regression achieves what residual regression claims to do. 4. Several measures of correlation exist that differ in the way that variance is partitioned among independent variables. These can be estimated multiply, or sequentially if reasons exist for estimating effects of variables in a hierarchical manner."

This suggests that sequence separation per contact and total number of contacts are both important in determining the rate of folding. Here, the two factors are incorporated into a new parameter, total contact distance (TCD). Using a database of 28 two-state or weakly three-state folding proteins, TCD is found to be the most accurate among the three parameters (CO, LRO, and TCD) in terms of correlation and prediction. It provides even more accurate prediction than the best neural network results with two descriptors (contact order and stability per residue). The improvement is achieved in all three-structural classes (all α, β, and mixed). The accuracy of total contact distance in predicting folding rates is essentially unchanged if ""short""-ranged contacts (|i - j| ≤ 14) are not included in calculation. Thus, only long-range contacts with a sequence separation of more than 14 residues are important in determining the rate of folding. This is consistent with the results from the long-range order parameter. One of the significant outliers in prediction is found to be associated with the only protein in the database that involves nonlocal disulfide bonds. Removing the protein leads to a correlation coefficient of 0.89 between experimental observed and predicted folding rates in jackknife cross validation. The corresponding values for CO and LRO are 0.71 and 0.80, respectively."

After adjusting for the complex sample design, we compared the distributions of HbA1c in subgroups and developed multiple linear regression models to examine factors associated with HbA 1c. RESULTS - Mean HbA1c level was 4.99% (SD 0.50%) and varied from 4.93% (95% CI ± 0.04) in non-Hispanic whites to 5.05% (±0.02) in Mexican-Americans to 5.17% (±0.02) in non-Hispanic blacks. There were very small differences among subgroups. Within each age-group, among men and women, among overweight and nonoverweight subjects, and at any level of education, mean HbA1c levels were higher in non-Hispanic blacks than in non-Hispanic whites. After adjusting for confounders, HbA1c levels for non-Hispanic blacks (5.15%, 95% CI ±0.04) and Mexican-Americans (5.01%, ±0.04) were higher than those for non-Hispanic whites (4.93%, ±0.04). CONCLUSIONS - These data provide national reference levels for HbA1c distributions among Americans aged 5-24 years and show statistically significant racial/ethnic differences in HbA1c levels that are not completely explained by demographic and health-related variables."

Various techniques have been utilized to classify arrhythmias. Generally, these techniques classify two or three arrhythmias or have significantly large processing times. A simpler autoregressive modeling (AR) technique is proposed to classify normal sinus rhythm (NSR) and various cardiac arrhythmias including atrial premature contraction (APC), premature ventricular contraction (PVC), superventricular tachycardia (SVT), ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF). Methods: AR Modeling was performed on ECG data from normal sinus rhythm as well as various arrhythmias. The AR coefficients were computed using Burg's algorithm. The AR coefficients were classified using a generalized linear model (GLM) based algorithm in various stages. Results: AR modeling results showed that an order of four was sufficient for modeling the ECG signals. The accuracy of detecting NSR, APC, PVC, SVT, VT and VF were 93.2% to 100% using the GLM based classification algorithm. Conclusion: The results show that AR modeling is useful for the classification of cardiac arrhythmias, with reasonably high accuracies. Further validation of the proposed technique will yield acceptable results for clinical implementation. © 2002 Ge et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

Methods and Results - Accordingly, we evaluated 547 patients with this diagnosis enrolled in the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD) between January 1996 and December 1999. Univariate testing followed by multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of death. In-hospital mortality rate was 32.5% in type A dissection patients. In-hospital complications (neurological deficits, altered mental status, myocardial or mesenteric ischemia, kidney failure, hypotension, cardiac tamponade, and limb ischemia) were increased in patients who died compared with survivors (P<0.05 for all). Logistic regression identified the following presenting variables as predictors of death: age ≥70 years (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.05 to 2.77; P=0.03), abrupt onset of chest pain (OR 2.60; 95% CI, 1.22 to 5.54; P=0.01), hypotension/shock/tamponade (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.83 to 4.81; P<0.0001), kidney failure (OR, 4.77; 95% CI, 1.80 to 12.6; P=0.002), pulse deficit (OR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.25 to 3.29, P=0.004), and abnormal ECG (OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.06 to 2.95; P=0.03) (area under receiver operating curve, 0.74; Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic, P=0.75). Conclusions - The in-hospital mortality rate in acute type A aortic dissection is high and can be predicted with the use of a clinical model incorporated in a simple risk prediction tool. This tool can be used to educate patients with dissection about their predicted risk and in clinical research for risk adjustment while comparing outcomes of different therapies."

Patients, diagnosed with one of four cancers, were recruited if their haemoglobin level was < 12 g dl−1 (female) or < 13 g dl-1 (male). The condition-specific Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Anaemia and the generic SF-36 were used to assess quality-of-life. Thirty-six per cent of the 179 recruited patients had breast cancer, 28% ovarian cancer, 25% lung cancer, and 11% multiple myeloma. Their mean (s.d.) haemoglobin level was 10.66 (1.04) g dl−1. Partial correlations controlling for the potentially confounding effects of age, gender, and time since diagnosis found significant positive relationships between haemoglobin and all domains of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Anaemia, and with all but two of the SF-36 domains. On linear regression controlling for the same factors, each unit haemoglobin rise equalled an average 8.19 Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Anaemia, and an average 6.88 Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Fatigue, increase. Haemoglobin accounted for a similar amount of variability (8%) in SF-36 scores. In conclusion, quality-of-life has been found to be significantly positively related to haemoglobin level in anaemic cancer patients. This suggests that normalisation of haemoglobin in cancer patients is likely to increase their quality-of-life. The greater sensitivity of the condition-specific Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Anaemia compared with the generic SF-36 suggests that the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Anaemia can be used alone to assess quality-of life in this patient group. © 2002 Cancer Research UK."

RSF models often are fitted using generalized linear models (GLMs) although a variety of statistical models might be used. Information criteria such as the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) are tools that can be useful for selecting a model from a set of biologically plausible candidates. Statistical inference procedures, such as the likelihood-ratio test, can be used to assess whether models deviate from random null models. But for most applications of RSF models, usefulness is evaluated by how well the model predicts the location of organisms on a landscape. Predictions from RSF models constructed using presence/absence (used/unused) data can be evaluated using procedures developed for logistic regression, such as confusion matrices, Kappa statistics, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. However, RSF models estimated from presence/available data create unique problems for evaluating model predictions. For presence/available models we propose a form of k-fold cross validation for evaluating prediction success. This involves calculating the correlation between RSF ranks and area-adjusted frequencies for a withheld sub-sample of data. A similar approach can be applied to evaluate predictive success for out-of-sample data. Not all RSF models are robust for application in different times or different places due to ecological and behavioral variation of the target organisms. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, it can be shown that a correlation coefficient very close to one might also be obtained for a clear curved relationship. Other statistical tests, like the Lack-of-fit and Mandel's fitting test thus appear more suitable for the validation of the linear calibration model. A number of cadmium calibration curves from atomic absorption spectroscopy were assessed for their linearity. All the investigated calibration curves were characterized by a high correlation coefficient (r >0.997) and low quality coefficient (QC <5%), but the straight-line model was systematically rejected at the 95% confidence level on the basis of the Lack-of-fit and Mandel's fitting test. Furthermore, significantly different results were achieved between a linear regression model (LRM) and a quadratic regression (QRM) model in forecasting values for mid-scale calibration standards. The results obtained with the QRM did not differ significantly from the theoretically expected value, while those obtained with the LRM were systematically biased. It was concluded that a straight-line model with a high correlation coefficient, but with a lack-of-fit, yields significantly less accurate results than its curvilinear alternative."

The large-scale convective envelope associated with this disturbance, with a zonal scale of approximately 1000-2000 km, propagates eastward at 15 m s-1 along the mean convective axis of the ITCZ. This envelope consists of many smaller-scale, westward-moving convective elements, with zonal scales on the order of 100-500 km. As the convectively coupled Kelvin wave disturbance propagates eastward, it exerts a strong control on local convection. Radar and vertical profiler data collected aboard the NOAA R/V Ronald H. Brown during the wave passage show that convection deepens rapidly as the Kelvin wave approaches from the west, progressing from isolated, shallow cumuli to organized deep convective features within just 12 h. Initially, rainfall in the vicinity of the ship consists of a significant deep convective fraction, but as the large-scale envelope departs to the east, stratiform precipitation becomes dominant. Radiosonde data collected during the Kelvin wave passage reveal dynamical perturbations in the troposphere and lower stratosphere that are consistent with linear equatorial Kelvin wave theory. The TEPPS radiosonde data also compare remarkably well with the vertical structure of a typical eastern Pacific Kelvin wave disturbance in the ECMWF reanalysis dataset, based on a 15-yr linear regression analysis. When this analysis is expanded to include all global grid points, it is shown that Kelvin waves in the eastern Pacific ITCZ have a dynamical structure that is nearly symmetric with respect to the equator, as would be expected based on linear Kelvin wave theory. However, the convective signal associated with these symmetric dynamical perturbations is itself primarily asymmetric with respect to the equator. The deepest convection is located significantly to the north of the equator, in the region of warmest sea surface temperatures. These observations present a somewhat different perspective on the dynamics of convectively coupled Kelvin waves, in that the symmetric dynamical fields and asymmetric convection interact to sustain the simultaneous eastward propagation of both fields."

Methods: In 53 children infected with E. coli O157:H7, we measured a panel of markers indicating activation of the clotting cascade and renal function within four days after the onset of illness. These markers were measured again in as many as possible of the 16 children in whom the hemolytic-uremic syndrome developed. Results: The children in whom the hemolytic-uremic syndrome subsequently developed had significantly higher median plasma concentrations of prothrombin fragment 1+2, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen, t-PA-plasminogen-activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) complex, and D-dimer than children with uncomplicated infection. These abnormalities preceded the development of azotemia and thrombocytopenia. When the hemolytic-uremic syndrome developed, the urinary concentrations of beta 2-microglobulin and N-acetyl-Β-glucosaminidase rose significantly (P=0.03 for both increases); the plasma concentrations of t-PA antigen, t-PA-PAI-1 complex, D-dimer, and plasmin-antiplasmin complex also increased significantly. The concentration of t-PA antigen correlated with that of the t-PA-PAI-1 complex in a linear regression model (squared correlation coefficient, 0.80; P< 0.001).

Methods and Results - We randomized 43 hypercholesterolemic patients (21 men, 22 women, age 63±11 years) to either simvastatin, to achieve >20% reduction of total cholesterol, or simvastatin plus 600 mg/d vitamin E for 2 months, Patients were then crossed over to the alternative treatment. Lipid parameters documented patients' compliance to simvastatin, whereas plasma levels of vitamin E documented compliance and absorption of vitamin E. We assessed urinary excretion of the isoprostane 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α (8-iso-PGF2α) as an in vivo index of oxidative stress at baseline and after each month of therapy. 8-Iso-PGF2α was significantly reduced by simvastatin, from 361±148 pg/mg creatinine (mean±SD) at baseline to 239±124 pg/mg creatinine after 1 month. The addition of vitamin E did not reduce such levels any further (256±125 after 1 month), Linear regression analysis showed a weak inverse relationship of 8-iso-PGF2α with vitamin E levels but a much stronger relationship with LDL cholesterol (R2=0.162; P<0.001). Conclusions - In hypercholesterolemic patients, LDL cholesterol is a major correlate of oxidative stress. Concomitant with LDL cholesterol reduction, simvastatin causes a drastic reduction of oxidative stress to a level that is not further reduced by the addition of vitamin E. Results of clinical trials with vitamin E may have been hampered by inadequate knowledge of the background level of lipid peroxidation, which is a major determinant of vitamin E bioactivity."

Concentrations of total folate, 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate (in serum and in erythrocytes) and of homocysteine, cysteine and cysteine-glycine and the MTHFR genotype were determined before the start of the study, after 6 weeks, and after 48 weeks or on withdrawal from the study. Blood was drawn from fasting patients at a standardized time in the morning, 16 h after intake of MTX. The laboratory results were related to parameters of efficacy and toxicity of MTX treatment. Results. Baseline values were distributed equally in the three treatment groups. The mean plasma homocysteine level (normal range 6-15 μmol/l) before the start of MTX was relatively high in all groups: 15.4 μmol/l [95% confidence interval (CI) 13.5 to 17.2] in the MTX plus placebo group (n = 39), 14.3 μmol/l (95% CI 12.2 to 16.4) in the MTX plus folic acid group (n = 35) and 15.9 μmol/l (95% CI 13.7 to 18.1) in the MTX plus folinic acid group (n = 39). After 48 weeks of MTX therapy, the mean homocysteine level showed an increase in the placebo group (+3.6 μmol/l, 95% CI 1.7 to 5.6). In contrast, a decrease was observed in the groups supplemented with folic or folinic acid (folic acid, -2.7 μmol/l, 95% CI - 1.4 to - 4.0; folinic acid, - 1.6 μmol/l, 95% CI - 0.1 to - 3.0). The differences in the change in plasma homocysteine level between the placebo group and each of the two folate-supplemented groups were statistically significant (P < 0.0001), contrary to the difference between the folic and folinic acid groups (P = 0.26). Linear regression analysis showed that the change in plasma homocysteine level was statistically significantly associated with folic or folinic acid supplementation (P = 0.0001) but not with the presence or absence of the C677T mutation in the MTHFR gene. Homozygous mutants had a higher plasma homocysteine concentration at baseline. No relationship was found between the change in disease activity and the change in homocysteine concentration or the mean homocysteine concentration after 48 weeks of MTX therapy. Toxicity-related discontinuation of MTX treatment was not associated with the change in homocysteine concentration. Conclusions. Low-dose MTX treatment in RA patients leads to an increased plasma homocysteine level. Concomitant folate supplementation with either folic or folinic acid decreases the plasma homocysteine level and consequently protects against potential cardiovascular risks. No relationship was found between the change in homocysteine concentration and the presence or absence of the C677T mutation in the MTHFR gene. Homocysteine metabolism was not associated with efficacy or toxicity of MTX treatment."

Design: A 12-month prospective cohort study. Setting: Four hospital-based renal units in London, UK. Patients: 174 patients that were 70 years or older at the start of dialysis, separated into two cohorts: 78 new patients (36 PD, 42 HD) that were recruited after 90 days of chronic dialysis; and 96 stock patients (42 PD, 54 HD) that were already on dialysis during the recruitment period. Main Outcome Measures: 12-month survival and hospitalization rate, and QOL assessed at baseline and at 6 and 12 months by the SF-36 and the Symptoms/Problems scale of the Kidney Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (KDQOL). Results: Peritoneal dialysis and HD patients were similar for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Annual mortality and hospitalization rates in PD versus HD patients were 26.1 versus 26.4 deaths/100 person-years and 1.9 versus 2.0 admissions/person-year, respectively. Adjusted relative risks showed no effect of modality on clinical outcomes. Multiple linear regression analyses of QOL at baseline showed similar SF-36 scores between PD and HD patients, but higher KDQOL scores in PD patients (3.5 points higher, 95% confidence interval 0.3 - 6.6). There was, however, no effect of dialysis modality on QOL at 6 or 12 months. Conclusions: Clinical outcomes and QOL are similar in elderly people on PD and HD. Peritoneal dialysis is a viable option for more than a carefully selected minority of elderly people requiring dialysis."

Cylindrical specimens of human vertebral trabecular bone (from T10 to L4) were cored from 32 cadavers (mean ± SD age = 70.1 ± 16.8; 13 females, 19 males) and scanned using QCT. Mechanical tests were conducted using a protocol that minimized end-artifacts over the apparent density range tested (0.09-0.38 g/cm3). To account for the presence of multiple specimens per donor in this data set, donor was treated as a random effect in the regression model. Mean modulus (319 ± 189 MPa) was higher and mean yield strain (0.78 ± 0.06%) was lower than typical values reported previously due to minimization of the end-artifact errors. QCT density showed a strong positive correlation with modulus (n = 76) and yield stress (r2 = 0.90-0.95, n = 53, p < 0.001). There was a weak positive linear correlation with yield strain (r2 = 0.58, n = 53, p = 0.07). Prediction errors, incurred when estimating modulus or strength for specimens from a new donor, were 30-36% of the mean values of these properties. Direct QCT density-mechanical property regressions gave more precise predictions of mechanical properties than if physically measured wet apparent density was used as an intermediate variable to predict mechanical properties from QCT density. Use of these QCT density-mechanical property regressions should improve the fidelity of QCT-based biomechanical models of the human spine for whole bone and bone-implant analyses. © 2002 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Lower plasma levels of adiponectin have been documented in human subjects with metabolic syndrome and coronary artery disease. We investigated whether the level of this putative protective adipocytokine could be increased by treatment with a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) agonist in diabetic patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Type 2 diabetic patients (30 in the treatment group and 34 in the placebo group) were recruited for a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial for 6 months with the PPAR-γ agonist rosiglitazone. Blood samples were collected and metabolic variables and adiponectin levels were determined in all patients before initiation of the study. RESULTS - In the rosiglitazone group, mean plasma adiponectin level was increased by more than twofold (P < 0.0005), whereas no change was observed in the placebo group. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that whether rosiglitazone was used was the single variable significantly related to the changes of plasma adiponectin. The amount of variance in changes of plasma adiponectin level explained by the treatment was ∼24% (r2 = 0.24) after adjusting for age, sex, and changes in fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, insulin resistance index, and BMI. CONCLUSIONS - Rosiglitazone increases plasma adiponectin levels in type 2 diabetic subjects. Whether this may contribute to the antihyperglycemic and putative antiatherogenic benefits of PPAR-γ agonists in type 2 diabetic patients warrants further investigation."

We aimed to compare 6 widely used rating scales for leukoaraiosis and to calculate conversion coefficients of the score of 1 scale in the score of a second scale. Methods - Two trained raters evaluated 80 pairs of CT and MRI scans using 2 CT and 4 MRI rating scales for white matter changes. Correlations among the scales were evaluated and regression lines were constructed with each of the CT and MRI scale scores as variables. Results - A high correlation was observed in all the paired comparisons of the 6 scales (Spearman's ρ ranging from 0.85 to 0.96, P<0.0001). Using regression analysis, we determined numeric parameters to transform the score of 1 scale to the corresponding score for each of the remaining scales and relative confidence intervals. The predictive values of these conversions expressed as R2 ranged from 0.75 to 0.92. Conclusions - The present findings support the view that a good correlation exists among the considered visual rating scales for white matter changes. With the limitation that conversion parameters are calculated by applying a linear regression to partly nonlinear scales, their use allows comparison of the results of previous studies that used different scales and to pool data from past and ongoing clinical trials."

To estimate the total hours of paid and unpaid personal assistance of daily living provided to adults living at home in the United States using nationally representative household survey data. Data Sources. The Disability Followback Survey of the National Health Interview Survey on Disability (NHIS-D) conducted from 1994 to 1997. Data Collection/Extraction Methods. Data were obtained on persons receiving help with up to 5 ADLs and 10 IADLs, for up to 4 helpers, including the activities they helped with, whether the helper was paid or not, and the number of hours of help provided in the two weeks prior to the survey. The sample consists of 8,471 household-resident adults ages 18 and older receiving help with personal assistance. About 22 percent of the sample has missing data on hours, which we impute by multiple regression models using demographic, ADL, and IADL variables. Findings. We estimate that 13.2 million noninstitutionalized adults receive an average of 31.4 hours per week of personal assistance in ADLs and IADLs per week, with 3.2 million people receiving an average of 17.6 hours of paid help and 11.7 million receiving an average of 30.7 hours of unpaid help. More persons ages 18-64 received help than those ages 65 and older (6.9 versus 6.2 million), but working-age recipients had fewer hours (27.4 versus 35.9) per week, due in part to less severe levels of disability. Conclusions. Personal assistance provided to adults with disabilities amounts to 21.5 billion hours of help per year, with an economic value in 1996 approaching $200 billion. Only 16 percent of this total is paid, representing $32 billion in home health services spent annually. This study, the first to estimate hours of assistance for both working-age and older adults, documents that older persons are more likely to receive paid personal assistance, while working-age people rely to a greater extent on unpaid help. This study begins to articulate the division of labor in the provision of personal assistance. Estimates of paid and unpaid hours of help by number of ADLs should inform policy concerning eligibility boundaries in long term care."

Sixteen clinical and laboratory variables were recorded at the time of diagnosis in 193 Canadian C282Y homozygous patients. All patients underwent percutaneous liver biopsy and 27 (14%) had biopsy specimen-proven cirrhosis. Prediction of cirrhosis was assessed first by univariate regression analysis. Variables significantly related to cirrhosis were then evaluated by stepwise linear multivariate regression. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of the most informative variables from multivariate analysis was then used to devise a clinically applicable index for the noninvasive prediction of cirrhosis. This index was then validated in 162 C282Y homozygous patients in France. Ferritin, blood platelets, and aspartate transaminase (AST) level were selected for the clinical index. The combination of ferritin levels of 1,000 μg/L or greater, platelet levels of 200 x 109/L or less, and AST levels above the upper limit of normal led to a correct diagnosis of cirrhosis in 77% of Canadian patients. In the French patients, this led to a correct diagnosis of cirrhosis in 90%. In conclusion, in C282Y homozygous patients, a combination of easily measured laboratory variables (ferritin, platelets, AST) can be used to make the diagnosis of cirrhosis in approximately 81% of cases, reducing the need for liver biopsy."

Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs can cause regression of adenomas, but whether they can prevent adenomas is unknown. Methods: We conducted a randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled study of 41 young subjects (age range, 8 to 25 years) who were genotypically affected with familial adenomatous polyposis but phenotypically unaffected. The subjects received either 75 or 150 mg of sulindac orally twice a day or identical-appearing placebo tablets for 48 months. The number and size of new adenomas and side effects of therapy were evaluated every four months for four years, and the levels of five major prostaglandins were serially measured in biopsy specimens of normal-appearing colorectal mucosa. Results: After four years of treatment, the average rate of compliance exceeded 76 percent in the sulindac group, and mucosal prostaglandin levels were lower in this group than in the placebo group. During the course of the study, adenomas developed in 9 of 21 subjects (43 percent) in the sulindac group and 11 of 20 subjects in the placebo group (55 percent) (P=0.54). There were no significant differences in the mean number (P=0.69) or size (P=0.17) of polyps between the groups. Sulindac did not slow the development of adenomas, according to an evaluation involving linear longitudinal methods.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Eighty-nine patients with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, ascertained from a large therapeutic randomized controlled trial, were included in this cross-sectional, observational cohort study. Morphological severity of DSP was expressed as the FD in the sural nerve biopsy. The Toronto CSS was applied to all patients to determine a clinical neuropathy score. General linear regression models were used to assess the relationship between the morphological severity of DSP and the Toronto CSS. RESULTS - The Toronto CSS showed a significant negative correlation with sural nerve FD (R2 = 0.256, P < 0.0001). The Toronto CSS was lower in those with better glycemic control (HbA 1c ≤8%). Sural nerve FD and the Toronto CSS showed strong correlations with electrophysiology, by both summed amplitude and summed conduction velocity values. CONCLUSIONS - The Toronto CSS is a valid instrument to reflect the presence and severity of DSP as measured by sural nerve morphology and electrophysiology. The results of the current study underscore the interrelationships between clinical deficits, electrophysiological findings, and morphological changes in DSP.

Serum albumin concentration is a balance among its synthesis rate, fractional catabolic rate (FCR), distribution, dilution in the plasma pool and external loss. The physiologic bases for establishing the level of serum albumin in hemodialysis patients have not been defined despite the association of hypoalbuminemia with excess mortality. Albumin concentration is associated with the levels of several acute phase proteins (APPs), C-reactive protein (CRP), α1 acid glycoprotein (α1 AG), or ceruloplasmin, and with nutritional markers, such as normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR). Methods. To establish the relationship among parameters that regulate albumin levels and markers of nutrition and inflammation, we injected [125I]-albumin, into 64 hemodialysis patients enrolled in the HEMO study to measure albumin distribution, synthesis and FCR. These variables were related to the levels of acute phase proteins (APPs), nPCR, body mass index (BMI), external albumin loss as well as demographic variables. Albumin distribution, synthesis and FCR were calculated from kinetic modeling, as was the initial plasma volume (PV). Serum albumin, transferrin, CRP, ceruloplasmin and α1 AG were measured weekly. Dialysate was collected during one dialysis each week to measure albumin loss. Results were analyzed by multiple linear regression. Results. Albumin concentration correlated with its synthesis rate and FCR, but not with PV or its distribution between the vascular and extravascular pools. Albumin concentration also correlated with nPCR and α1 AG. However, albumin synthesis was directly related most strongly to PV and BMI (or nPCR), but not to levels of APPs. By contrast, albumin FCR correlated positively with both α1 AG and ceruloplasmin. Conclusion. Albumin concentration in dialysis patients changes with inflammation and nutritional status through their effects on albumin catabolism and synthesis, respectively. Within the range of albumin levels in these patients, nutritional variables primarily affected albumin synthesis while inflammation caused hypoalbuminemia by increasing albumin FCR. Albumin synthesis also increased in proportion to PV. The result of this is that PV expansion does not contribute to hypoalbuminemia."

Methods: We analyzed 68 fixed adult human hearts, divided into 48 hearts with dilated cardiomyopathy of ischemic or idiopathic origin and 20 hearts free of pathologic heart conditions. Digital images of the mitral ring perimeter, attachment of the anterior and posterior leaflets, and fibrous and muscular portions were collected. We also measured the internal perimeter of the left ventricle, the distance from the septum to the anterior and posterior papillary muscles, the distance between the papillary muscles, and the extension of interventricular septum. Results: The analysis of the results showed proportional distribution of the ring's fibrous portion (r2 = 0.98) and muscular portion (r2 = 0.99) according to the degree of mitral valve dilation. Linear regression revealed that the perimeters of anterior and posterior leaflet attachments (r2 = 0.96 and r2 = 0.98, respectively) also had a proportional relation. We did not observe proportionality between the degree of dilation of the mitral ring and the left ventricle. It was observed that dilation of the left ventricle takes place globally in its segments. Conclusion: Differently from what was thought, in ischemic or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, dilation of mitral ring is proportional and does not exclusively affect the posterior portion. The degree of left ventricular dilation does not determine the degree of dilation of the mitral ring because they are independent processes. These observations shed new light on the techniques used to correct mitral valve insufficiency in dilated cardiomyopathy."

DESIGN: Cross-sectional validation study of sedentary individuals. SUBJECTS: The Heritage Family Study cohort of 665 black and white men and women who ranged in age from 17 to 65y. MEASUREMENTS: Body density determined from hydrostatic weighing. Percentage body fat determined with gender and race-specific, two-compartment models. BMI determined from height and weight, and sex and race in dummy coded form. RESULTS: Polynomial regression showed that the relationship between %fat and BMI was quadratic for both men and women. A natural log transformation of BMI adjusted for the non-linearity. Test for homogeneity of log transformed BMI and gender showed that the male-female slopes were within random variance, but the intercepts differed. For the same BMI, the %fat of females was 10.4% higher than that of males. General linear models analysis of the women's data showed that age, race and race-by-BMI interaction were independently related to %fat. The same analysis applied to the men's data showed that %fat was not just a function of BMI, but also age and age-by-BMI interaction. Multiple regression analyses provided models that defined the bias. CONCLUSIONS: These data and results published in the literature show that BMI and %fat relationship are not independent of age and gender. These data showed a race effect for women, but not men. The failure to adjust for these sources of bias resulted in substantial differences in the proportion of subjects defined as obese by measured %fat."

Methods and Results - Our results in rat cardiac allografts established alloimmune response as an alternative stimulus capable of inducing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA and protein expression in cardiomyocytes and graft-infiltrating mononuclear inflammatory cells, which suggests that these cells may function as a source of VEGF to the cells of coronary arteries. Linear regression analysis of these allografts with different stages of arteriosclerotic lesions revealed a strong correlation between intragraft VEGF protein expression and the development of intimal thickening, whereas blockade of signaling downstream of VEGF receptor significantly reduced arteriosclerotic lesions. In addition, in cholesterol-fed rabbits, intracoronary perfusion of cardiac allografts with a clinical-grade adenoviral vector that encoded mouse VEGF164 enhanced the formation of arteriosclerotic lesions, possibly secondary to increased intragraft influx of macrophages and neovascularization in the intimal lesions. Conclusions - Our findings suggest a positive regulatory role between VEGF and coronary arteriosclerotic lesion formation in the allograft cytokine microenvironment."

Because low socioeconomic and minority populations have poorer diabetes outcomes and greater barriers to adherence, we examined the relationship between adherence and diabetes metabolic control in a large indigent population. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - The study population consisted of patients receiving medical care from a university-based internal medicine clinic serving a low-income population in rural central Virginia. The sample comprised 810 patients with type 2 diabetes who received oral diabetes medications from the clinic pharmacy and had at least one HbA1c determination during the study period. Multiple linear regression was used to examine the association of HbA1c level as well as change in HbA1c level with medication adherence, demographic, and clinical characteristics. RESULTS - Better metabolic control was independently associated with greater medication adherence, increasing age, white (versus African-American) race, and lower intensity of drug therapy. For each 10% increment in drug adherence, HbA1c decreased by 0.16% (P < 0.0001). Controlling for other demographic and clinical variables, the mean HbA1c of African-Americans was 0.29% higher than that of whites (P = 0.04). Additionally, the intensity of diabetes drug therapy for African-Americans was lower, as was their measured adherence to it. There was no association between metabolic control and gender, income, encounter frequency, frequency of HbA1c testing, or continuity of care. CONCLUSIONS - Adherence to medication regimens for type 2 diabetes is strongly associated with metabolic control in an indigent population; African-Americans have lower adherence and worse metabolic control. Greater efforts are clearly needed to facilitate diabetes self-management behaviors of low-income populations and foster culturally sensitive and appropriate care for minority groups."

However, treed models go further than conventional trees (e.g. CART, C4.5) by fitting models rather than a simple mean or proportion within each subset. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian approach for finding and fitting parametric treed models, in particular focusing on Bayesian treed regression. The potential of this approach is illustrated by a cross-validation comparison of predictive performance with neural nets, MARS, and conventional trees on simulated and real data sets."

It has two major drawbacks: it may make inefficient use of data, and it requires the user to manually tune a stepsize schedule for good performance. For the case of linear value function approximations and λ = 0, the Least-Squares TD (LSTD) algorithm of Bradtke and Barto (1996, Machine learning, 22:1-3,33-57) eliminates all stepsize parameters and improves data efficiency. This paper updates Bradtke and Barto's work in three significant ways. First, it presents a simpler derivation of the LSTD algorithm. Second, it generalizes from λ = 0 to arbitrary values of λ at the extreme of λ = 1, the resulting new algorithm is shown to be a practical, incremental formation of supervised linear regression. Third, it presents a novel and intuitive interpretation of LSTD as a model-based reinforcement learning technique."

The relationship between body mass index (BMI) and the development of an objective marker for asthma, methacholine airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), was investigated in adult men. Methods: Sixty one men who had no AHR at initial methacholine challenge testing but who developed AHR about 4 years later and 244 matched controls participated in the study. The effects of initial BMI and change in BMI on development of AHR were examined in conditional logistic regression models. Results: Initial BMI was found to have a non-linear relationship with development of AHR. Compared with men with initial BMI in the middle quintile, men with BMI in the lowest quintile (BMI=19.8-24.3 kg/m2) and those with BMI in the highest quintile (BMI >29.4 kg/m2) were more likely to develop AHR: OR=7.0 (95% Cl 1.8 to 27.7) and OR=10.0 (95% Cl 2.6 to 37.9), respectively. These results remained significant after controlling for age, smoking, IgE level, and initial FEV1. In addition, there was a positive linear relationship between change in BMI over the period of observation and the subsequent development of AHR. Conclusions: In this cohort of adult men, both a low BMI and a high BMI were associated with the development of AHR. For men with a low initial BMI the increased risk for development of AHR appears to be partly mediated by a gain in weight. The effect of BMI on AHR may suggest mechanisms in the observed associations between obesity and asthma."

A retrospective evaluation of radiographs in patients with idiopathic scoliosis was undertaken to assess predictors of flexibility. Objective. To evaluate potential predictors of flexibility in patients with thoracolumbar and lumbar scoliosis. Summary of Background Data. Curve flexibility is an important consideration in the operative management of idiopathic scoliosis. Flexibility of the major curve is a useful predictor of expected surgical correction, and flexibility of compensatory curves determines whether they are structural or nonstructural. An accurate assessment of curve flexibility has important implications on surgical approaches and planning for deformity correction. The role of age and curve magnitude in predicting curve flexibility has not been well defined. A quantitative assessment of changes in curve flexibility with age and progression of deformity may yield important insight into the change in surgical management options over time. Methods. A retrospective review of 75 patients with idiopathic thoracolumbar and lumbar scoliosis (age range 13-78 years) was undertaken. Preoperative standing and side-bending radiographs of thoracolumbar and lumbar curves were evaluated. Cobb angles of structural and fractional curves, curve flexibility, presence of lateral listhesis, and axial and radicular pain were documented. Predictors of structural and fractional curve flexibility were evaluated with correlation and regression analysis. Correlation analysis was used to demonstrate an association between radiographic findings and the clinical presentation. Results. Seventy-five patients had an average major curve magnitude of 56° (range 34-82°) with flexibility averaging 55% (range 20-93%). Structural curve flexibility was highly inversely correlated with both curve magnitude (r = -0.7; P < 0.001) and with age (r = -0.6; P < 0.001). Lumbar fractional curve (L4-S1) flexibility showed a high inverse correlation with age (r = -0.65; P < 0.001) but did not show correlation with Cobb angle. Thoracic compensatory curves showed a moderate correlation with Cobb angle (r = 0.53). Structural and fractional curve flexibility showed high correlation with each other (r = 0.5-0.66). Regression analysis yielded a formula to predict the flexibility of the structural curve (FSC): FSC = 130 - (Cobb + Age/2). Axial pain was correlated with age (r = 0.63); however, it was not correlated with curve magnitude. Conclusion. We have shown that curve magnitude and patient age are the main predictors of structural flexibility. Every 10° increase in curve magnitude over 40° results in a 10% decrease in flexibility; every 10-year increase in age decreases flexibility of the structural curve by 5% and the lumbosacral fractional curve by 10%. Curve magnitude and age of the patients are significant predictors of curve flexibility. The demonstration of this association offers useful information in estimating how surgical options for deformity correction may change over time."

Recent attention has focused on the shape of the concentration-response curve, particularly at low doses. Several articles have reported that particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 μ (PM10) was associated with daily deaths with no evidence of a threshold. These reports have use smoothing or spline methods in individual cities and pooled the results multiple cities to obtain estimates that are more robust. To date, fine particulate matter (aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 μ; PM2.5), a components of PM10, has not been examined in this regard. We examined this association in a hierarchical model is six U.S. cities. In the first stage, we fit log-linear models including smooth functions of PM2.5 in each city, controlling for season, weather, and day of the week. These smooth functions allowed fo nonlinearities in the city-specific associations. We combined the estimated curves across cities using a hierarchical model that allows for heterogeneity. We found an essentially linear relationship down to 2 μg/m3. The same approach was applied to examine the concentration response to traffic particles, controlling for particles from other sources. Once again, the association showed no sign of a threshold. The magnitude of the association suggests that controlling fine particle pollution would result in thousands fewer early death per year."

Less consistently reported are findings of regional abnormalities such as selective differences in thalamic volume. The authors applied an unbiased technique to test for differences in cerebral morphometry between patients with schizophrenia and matched comparison subjects. Method: T1-weighted images from 20 schizophrenic patients and matched comparison subjects were processed by using optimized automated voxel-based morphometry within multiple linear regression analyses. Results: Global differences in gray matter volume were seen between the schizophrenic and comparison subjects, with selective regional gray matter differences noted in the mediodorsal thalamus and across cortical regions, including the ventral and medial prefrontal cortices. Within the schizophrenic subjects, a relationship was observed between gray matter volume loss in the medial prefrontal cortex and a positive family history of schizophrenia. There was no significant difference between patients and comparison subjects in rates of proportional gray matter reduction with age. Conclusions: These observations confirm an association between thalamocortical morphometric abnormalities and schizophrenia, consistent with theoretical models of primary pathoetiological dysfunction in filtering, integration, and information transfer processes in patients with schizophrenia."

There is growing interest in comparing resource, as well as patient outcome metrics among coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) providers, yet few tools exist for adjusting these provider comparisons for patient case-mix. In this study, we aimed to define the magnitude of hospital variability in postoperative length of stay (PLOS) in contemporary practice and to determine the degree to which this variability was accounted for by differences in patient case-mix. We also sought to determine the relationship between hospitals' risk-adjusted PLOS and mortality outcomes. Methods. We analyzed 496,797 isolated CABG procedures performed between January 1997 to January 2001 at 587 US hospitals participating in the Society of Thoracic Surgeon's National Cardiac Database. Logistic and linear regression were used to identify independent preoperative factors affecting a patient's likelihood for early discharge (PLOS © Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved."

The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between trunk control at an early stage and comprehensive ADL function (as assessed by combining basic ADL and instrumental ADL [IADL]) in patients at 6 months after stroke. Methods - A total of 169 stroke patients participated in this prospective study. Trunk control was measured with the use of the trunk control items of the Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke Patients (PASS-TC). In addition to the PASS-TC score, age, sex, type of stroke, side of hemiparesis, urinary incontinence, limb paresis (measured by the Fugl-Meyer motor test), balance (measured by the Fugl-Meyer balance test), and basic ADL (measured by the Barthel Index) were also selected as predictor variables. These variables were assessed at 14 days after stroke or earlier. The Barthel Index and Frenchay Activities Index (measuring IADL) were administered at- 6 months after stroke. The sum of the standardized Barthel Index and standardized Frenchay Activities Index scores was used to assess comprehensive ADL function. Results - Multivariable stepwise linear regression analysis showed that PASS-TC score, age, Fugl-Meyer motor test score, and Barthel Index score (listed by the order of forward selection) were the strongest predictors of comprehensive ADL function. These results were internally validated with the use of the bootstrap resampling technique. The PASS-TC score alone accounted for 45% of the variance in predicting comprehensive ADL function. Results also indicated that the PASS-TC score had slightly more power in predicting comprehensive ADL function than either the Fugl-Meyer motor test score or Barthel Index score. Conclusions - The findings of this study provide strong evidence of the predictive value of trunk control on comprehensive ADL function in stroke patients. The results imply that early assessment and management of trunk control after stroke should be emphasized."

Associations between leg strength and BMD were also examined. Methods: Areal BMD (g·cm-2) was assessed by duel-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (total body (TB), lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (FN), legs, and arms). Right knee flexion and extension strength was measured using a Cybex Norm isokinetic dynamometer at 60°·s-1. Results: Runners had significantly higher unadjusted TB, LS, FN, and leg BMD than controls (P < 0.05); higher TB, FN, and leg BMD than swimmers (P < 0.05); and greater leg BMD than cyclists (P < 0.05). Absolute knee extension strength was significantly (P < 0.01) correlated (0.33 ≤ r ≤ 0.44) with TB, FN, LS, and leg BMD for all groups combined. Weaker but still significant correlations (0.28 ≤ r ≤ 0.33) existed for normalized (per leg lean tissue mass) knee extension strength and all BMD sites, except FN BMD. There were no significant correlations between absolute or normalized knee flexion strength and any of the BMD variables. Absolute knee extension strength was entered as the second independent predictor for LS and leg BMD in stepwise multiple linear regression analysis (MLRA), accounting for increments of 4% and 12%, respectively, in total explained variation. Conclusion: We conclude that running, a weight bearing exercise, is associated with larger site-specific BMD than swimming or cycling, that the generalized anatomical distribution of loads in triathlon appears not to significantly enhance total body BMD status, and that knee extension strength is only a weak correlate and independent predictor of BMD in adolescent females."

Setting: University hospital. Patients and design: A German version of the generic quality of life measure (SF-36) containing eight dimensions was administered to 205 patients with congestive heart failure and systolic dysfunction. Cardiopulmonary evaluation included assessment of New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, left ventricular ejection fraction, peak oxygen uptake, and the distance covered during a standardised six minute walk test. Results: Quality of life significantly decreased with NYHA functional class (linear trend: p < 0.0001). In NYHA class III, the scores of five of the eight quality of life domains were reduced to around one third of those in the general population. The pattern of reduction was different in patients with chronic hepatitis C and major depression, and similar in patients on chronic haemodialysis. Multiple regression analysis showed that only the NYHA functional class was consistently and closely associated with all quality of life scales. The six minute walk test and peak oxygen uptake added to the explanation of the variance in only one of the eight quality of life domains (physical functioning). Left ventricular ejection fraction, duration of disease, and age showed no clear association with quality of life. Conclusions: In congestive heart failure, quality of life decreases as NYHA functional class worsens. Though NYHA functional class was the most dominant predictor among the somatic variables studied, the major determinants of reduced quality of life remain unknown."

Methods: The feasibility of measuring lung function was examined in 652 children aged 3-6 years using dynamic spirometry with an animation programme and the guidelines approved by the European Respiratory Society. Results: Data from 603 (92%) children with at least two acceptable forced expiratory manoeuvres were analysed; 408 (68%) achieved at least three acceptable manoeuvres. Children with only two acceptable manoeuvres were younger, shorter, and weighed less (p<0.001). The lower levels of lung function in this group were partly explained by body size. 63% of those with three acceptable manoeuvres had a difference of ≤5% between the highest and second highest forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1); when a difference of ≤10% was applied, 91% of the children were included. A similar trend was seen for forced vital capacity (FVC). The acceptability and reproducibility increased with increasing age, and levels of lung function increased linearly with age. The linear regression model showed that standing height was a satisfactory predictor of lung function; the explained fraction of variance (R2) was 59% for FEV1. Most FVC manoeuvres in children older than 3 years were acceptable and reproducible. Conclusions: Spirometric testing is feasible in preschool children and may be useful for both clinical practice and research. This study may fill the deficiency in reference values for European preschool children."

Central corneal thickness (CCT) of 74 eyes from 39 normal Hong Kong Chinese subjects with ages ranging from 39 to 86 years were studied. Aim & Purpose. To compare the measurements of different devices and to compare the results of ethnic groups in other studies. Methods. Non-contact measurements by Orbscan and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) were first carried out, followed by contact measurement using Ultrasound Pachymetry. The results of five measurements of Ultrasound Pachymetry and three measurements of OCT and Orbscan were each averaged and compared using correlation, linear regression and one-way analysis of variance methods. Results. The measurements of three devices were significantly correlated (P < 0.01). The mean CCT in our study group measured by Orbscan (with an acoustic factor set at 0.92), Ultrasound Pachymetry and OCT were 555.96 ± 32.41, 555.11 ± 35.30 and 523.2 ± 33.54 μm respectively. A linear regression model (using ultrasound measurements as standard) was presented. Conclusions. When a correction factor of 32 μm was applied to OCT measurements, the means of three devices became significantly equal. The adjusted OCT measurements were less precise within subjects but more accurate than Orbscan when compared with ultrasound pachymetry as a reference standard.

A new method is presented which estimates and removes the fraction of BOLD signal that arises from oriented vessels, such as cerebral and pial veins in a voxel, by measuring their influence on the phase angle of the complex valued fMRI time series. A maximum likelihood estimator based on a linear least-squares fit of the BOLD signal phase to the BOLD signal magnitude in a voxel is shown to efficiently suppress the BOLD effect from these larger veins, whose activation is not well colocalized with the neural response. In high-resolution in vivo fMRI data at 4 T, it is estimated that the method is sensitive to the phase changes in the cerebral, larger intracortical, and pial veins. The technique requires no special pulse sequence modifications or acquisition strategies, and is computationally fast and intrinsically robust. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

The term severity has various connotations in drought literature such as in hydrological drought, where it is defined as the cumulative shortage or the deficit sum with reference to a pre-specified truncation level. In meteorological drought, the severity has rather been defined in the form of indices such as the Palmer drought severity index. There exist a variety of techniques and methods to analyse the duration and severity of meteorological and hydrological droughts through probability characterization of low flows, time series methods, synthetic data generation, theory of runs, multiple regression, group theory, pattern recognition and neural network methods. Agricultural droughts are analysed based on soil moisture modelling concepts with crop yield considerations and using multiple linear regression techniques. The prediction aspects of drought duration are developed better than the drought severity aspects. These latter need to be improved because information on drought severity is of paramount practical importance and forms an essential part of the design process of storage facilities for abatement of droughts. A major challenge of drought research is to develop suitable methods and techniques for forecasting the onset and termination points of droughts. An equally challenging task is the dissemination of drought research results for practical usage and wider applications. © 2002 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

While the quality of patient-physician relations has been associated with improved health outcomes and functional status, little is known about the impact of different patient-physician interaction styles on patients' diabetes self-management. This study assessed the influence of patients' evaluation of their physicians' participatory decision-making style, rating of physician communication, and reported understanding of diabetes self-care on their self-reported diabetes management. DESIGN: We surveyed 2,000 patients receiving diabetes care across 25 Veterans' Affairs facilities. We measured patients' evaluation of provider participatory decision making with a 4-item scale (Provider Participatory Decision-making Style [PDMstyle]; α = 0.96), rating of providers' communication with a 5-item scale (Provider Communication [PCOM]; α = 0.93), understanding of diabetes self-care with an 8-item scale (α = 0.90), and patients' completion of diabetes self-care activities (self-management) in 5 domains (α = 0.68). Using multivariable linear regression, we examined self-management with the independent associations of PDMstyle, PCOM, and Understanding. RESULTS: Sixty-six percent of the sample completed the surveys (N = 1,314). Higher ratings in PDMstyle and PCOM were each associated with higher self-management assessments (P < .01 in all models). When modeled together, PCOM remained a significant independent predictor of self-management (standardized β: 0.18; P < .001), but PDMstyle became nonsignificant. Adding Understanding to the model diminished the unique effect of PCOM in predicting self-management (standardized β: 0.10; P = .004). Understanding was strongly and independently associated with self-management (standardized β: 0.25; P < .001). CONCLUSION: For these patients, ratings of providers' communication effectiveness were more important than a participatory decision-making style in predicting diabetes self-management. Reported understanding of self-care behaviors was highly predictive of and attenuated the effect of both PDMstyle and PCOM on self-management, raising the possibility that both provider styles enhance self-management through increased patient understanding or self-confidence."

Design: Randomly selected respondents (n = 246) from the EPIC (diet-cancer) and MONICA (diet-cardiovascular disease) study cohort in Northern Sweden were invited to answer the FFQ twice over a one-year interval (FFQ1 and FFQ2), and to complete ten 24-hour recalls (reference method) in the months between. Plasma β-carotene concentrations were determined from a subset of 47 participants. Setting: Västerbotten and Norrbotten, Northern Sweden. Participants: Ninety-six men and 99 women, who completed the study. Results: The reproducibility of the FFQ was high in terms of both mean energy and nutrient intakes and relative ranking of participants by intake levels (median Pearson correlation of 0.68). Moderately higher food intake frequencies were recorded by FFQ1 compared with 24-hour recalls for dairy products, bread/cereals, vegetables, fruits and potato/rice/pasta, whereas meat, fish, sweet snacks and alcoholic beverage intakes were lower. The median Spearman coefficient of correlation between FFQ1 and the average of ten 24-HDR measurements was 0.50. Daily energy and nutrient intakes were similar for FFQ1 and 24-HDR measurements, except for fibre, vitamin C, β-carotene and retinol (FFQ1 > 24-HDR) and sucrose and cholesterol (FFQ1 < 24-HDR). Pearson coefficients of correlation between FFQ1 and 24-HDR corrected for attenuation due to residual day-to-day variation in the 24-HDR measurements ranged from 0.36 to 0.79 (median 0.54). Adjustment for energy had only very moderate effects on the correlation estimates. Calibration coefficients estimated by linear regression of the 24-HDR on the FFQ1 measurements varied between 0.30 and 0.59 for all nutrients except alcohol, which had calibration coefficients close to 1.0. These low calibration coefficients indicate that relative risk estimates corresponding to an absolute difference in dietary intake levels measured by the FFQ will generally be biased towards 1.0. Plasma β-carotene levels had a Pearson coefficient of correlation of 0.47 with the 24-HDR measurements, and of 0.23 with FFQ1 measurements. Conclusions: The Northern Sweden FFQ measurements have good reproducibility and an estimated level of validity similar to that of FFQ measurements in other prospective cohort studies. The results from this study will form the basis for the correction of attenuation and regression dilution biases in relative risk estimates, in future studies relating FFQ measurements to disease outcomes. © 2002 CABI Publishing."

The goal of this paper is to better understand the effects of neurovascular coupling in the visual and motor cortices using frequency-domain near-infrared spectroscopy. Maps of concentration changes in oxyhemoglobin [O2Hb], deoxyhemoglobin [HHb], and total hemoglobin of the visual and motor cortices were generated during stimulation using a reversing checkerboard screen and palm-squeezing, respectively. Seven healthy volunteers of 18-37 years of age were included. In the visual cortex the patterns of [O2Hb] and [HHb] were strongly linearly correlated (r2 > 0.8 in 13 of a total of 24 locations). In 20 locations the change in [O2Hb] was larger than 0.25 μM. The mean slope of the linear regression between [O2Hb] and [HHb] was -3.93 ± 0.31 (SE).

This was confirmed by the linear regression analysis (r2 > 0.8 in none of 40 locations). In 20 locations the change in [O2Hb] was larger than 0.25 μM. The mean slope of the regression line was -1.76 ± 0.20, which is significantly higher than that in the motor cortex (P < 0.0000001). Patterns of [O2Hb] and [HHb] differ among cortex areas. This implies that the regulation of perfusion in the visual cortex is different from that in the motor cortex. There is evidence that the CMRO2 increases substantially in the visual cortex, while this is not the case for the motor cortex. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA)."

This study reviews a single-center experience with JRAs. Methods: Between June 1994 and December 2000, 138 patients underwent elective repair of a JRA, comprising 16.1% of 859 consecutive asymptomatic and intact symptomatic nonruptured infrarenal AAAs repaired over the same period. All patients with JRA needed proximal suprarenal clamping (SRC) or supravisceral (SVC) clamping. Patient demographics, selected risk factors, and operative details were recorded. Univariate analyses of selected risk factors for an adverse perioperative event were assessed, and multivariate analyses were performed with linear and logistic regression with backwards selection. Results: SRC was used in 95 patients (69%), and 43 patients (31%) underwent SVC. The mortality rate was 5.1% (7/138) for JRA repair, and 2.8% (20/720) for infrarenal AAA repair (P = .03). The mortality rate was significantly greater for those patients who received SVC compared with SRC (11.6% versus 2.1%; P = .02). Multivariate analysis identified SVC position as the only independent predictor of mortality (odds ratio [OR], 6.1; 95% CI, 1.1 to 32.9; P = .035). Transient renal insufficiency occurred in 39 patients (28.3%), but only eight patients (5.8%) needed dialysis. Patients who had SVC had a significantly greater rate of renal insufficiency than those who received SRC (41.9% versus 22.1%; P = .02). Multivariate analysis showed SVC position (OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.4 to 7.8; P = .008), diabetes (OR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.1 to 12.9; P = .04), and preoperative renal insufficiency (OR, 5.8; 95% CI, 2.2 to 15.4; P < .001) were independent predictors of postoperative renal insufficiency. Renal ischemia during proximal clamping cannot alone explain renal complications because clamp time was shorter in patients with SVC (24.9 ± 2.4 minutes versus 32.2 ± 1.5 minutes; P = .009). Conclusion: JRA repair can be accomplished with a low mortality rate, but a more proximal clamp position may adversely affect outcome in these patients. Postoperative renal insufficiency is related to diabetes, preoperative renal insufficiency, and SVC position. These results suggest SRC is safer than SVC for proximal aortic clamp control of JRAs. Although clamp level must be tailored to patient anatomy, outcome may be improved if the clamp level can be kept distal to the superior mesenteric artery origin."

For simulations, all three methods decreased the noise-induced GA bias (up to 30%) at the expense of increased variability. The bias reduction was most pronounced for MA1, moderate to large for MA2, and modest to moderate for TLS. In addition, GA, TLS, and MA1, methods that used only a portion of the data (T >t*, chosen by an automatic process), showed a small V underestimation for [11C]MDL 100,907 with its slow kinetics, due to selection of t* before the true point of linearity. These noniterative methods are computationally simple, allowing efficient pixelwise parameter estimation. For tracers with kinetics that permit t* to be accurately identified within the study duration, MA1 appears to be the best. For tracers with slow kinetics and low to moderate noise, however, MA2 may provide the lowest bias while maintaining computational ease for pixelwise parameter estimation."

Because epoetin alfa has demonstrated efficacy in correcting cancer-related anaemia, the impact of this treatment on quality of life was evaluated in a multinational, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 375 anaemic cancer patients receiving non-platinum-based chemotherapy. The cancer-specific measures of quality of life included the general scale (FACT-G Total) and fatigue subscale (FACT-An Fatigue subscale) of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anaemia and the Cancer Linear Analogue Scales measuring energy, ability to do daily activities, and overall quality of life. These measures were also used to examine the relationship between haemoglobin levels and quality of life. Both univariate and multiple linear regression analyses of quality of life data were performed. Results of the univariate analysis have been reported previously. The a priori-planned multiple linear regression analysis, which accounted for the effects of disease progression and several other possibly confounding variables on quality of life, showed a significant advantage for epoetin alfa over placebo for the five scales (all, P < 0.05), and confirmed the results of the univariate analysis. For cancer-specific measures, significant correlations were demonstrated between baseline haemoglobin and quality of life (r, range: 0.14-0.26, all P < 0.05) and between change in haemoglobin and change in quality of life (r, range: 0.26-0.34, all P < 0.01).

It is not clear whether these associations also exist in middle age. The authors examined these relations in a population-based cohort study of 1,927 randomly selected, predominantly middle-aged subjects aged 45-70 years at the time of cognitive testing and living in the Netherlands. From 1995 until 2000, an extensive cognitive battery was administered, and compound scores were calculated. Risk factors had been assessed approximately 5 years previously. Multiple linear regression analyses (in which one unit of the cognitive score = one standard deviation) showed that, after the authors adjusted for age, sex, education, alcohol consumption, and cardiovascular risk factors, current smokers had reduced psychomotor speed (beta = -0.159, 95% confidence interval: -0.071, -0.244; p = 0.0003) and reduced cognitive flexibility (beta = -0.133, 95% confidence interval: -0.035, -0.230; p = 0.008) compared with never smokers. This effect was similar to that of being approximately 4 years older. Alcohol consumption was related to increased speed and better flexibility, especially among women who drank 1-4 alcoholic beverages a day. In conclusion, among middle-aged subjects, current smoking was inversely and alcohol consumption positively related to psychomotor speed and cognitive flexibility. This finding suggests that actions to prevent cognitive decline can be taken in middle age."

We formulate the problem as if all possible weak hypotheses had already been generated. The labels produced by the weak hypotheses become the new feature space of the problem. The boosting task becomes to construct a learning function in the label space that minimizes misclassification error and maximizes the soft margin. We prove that for classification, minimizing the 1-norm soft margin error function directly optimizes a generalization error bound. The equivalent linear program can be efficiently solved using column generation techniques developed for large-scale optimization problems. The resulting LPBoost algorithm can be used to solve any LP boosting formulation by iteratively optimizing the dual misclassification costs in a restricted LP and dynamically generating weak hypotheses to make new LP columns. We provide algorithms for soft margin classification, confidence-rated, and regression boosting problems. Unlike gradient boosting algorithms, which may converge in the limit only, LPBoost converges in a finite number of iterations to a global solution satisfying mathematically well-defined optimality conditions. The optimal solutions of LPBoost are very sparse in contrast with gradient based methods. Computationally, LPBoost is competitive in quality and computational cost to AdaBoost."

IOP was measured with air-puff tonometry. Results: The mean IOP of right eyes was 15.1 mmHg (SD 3.3) among men and 15.8 mmHg among women (SD 3.1), which is a statistically significant difference.

Linear regression analysis of the relationship between CCT and IOP suggests higher IOP measurements with thicker corneas. There was no significant correlation between age and CCT.

Most of the performance bounds for on-line algorithms in this framework assume a constant learning rate. To achieve these bounds the learning rate must be optimized based on a posteriori information. This information depends on the whole sequence of examples and thus it is not available to any strictly on-line algorithm. We introduce new techniques for adaptively tuning the learning rate as the data sequence is progressively revealed. Our techniques allow us to prove essentially the same bounds as if we knew the optimal learning rate in advance. Moreover, such techniques apply to a wide class of on-line algorithms, including p-norm algorithms for generalized linear regression and Weighted Majority for linear regression with absolute loss. Our adaptive tunings are radically different from previous techniques, such as the so-called doubling trick. Whereas the doubling trick restarts the on-line algorithm several times using a constant learning rate for each run, our methods save information by changing the value of the learning rate very smoothly. In fact, for Weighted Majority over a finite set of experts our analysis provides a better leading constant than the doubling trick. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA)."

Diagnosis of CTS in patients with DPN is important, as therapeutic interventions directed toward relief of CTS may be effective irrespective of diffuse neuropathy. The prevalence of clinical CTS and the most efficient electrodiagnostic discriminators of CTS from diffuse neuropathy are uncertain. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - A total of 478 subjects, including reference subjects (without diabetes and without neuropathy), nonneuropathic subjects with diabetes, and diabetic subjects with mild, moderate, and severe neuropathy, were evaluated in a cross-sectional design for clinical features of CTS. In the ascertainment of the cohort, a clinical stratification method was used to ensure a broad spectrum of neuropathy severity. All subjects underwent nerve conduction study determinations of median, ulnar, and sural nerve parameters. RESULTS - The prevalence of clinical CTS was 2% in the reference population, 14% in diabetic subjects without DPN, and 30% in those with DPN. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that mean electrodiagnostic parameters are not significant predictors of clinical CTS in patients with diabetes. Generally, the parameters worsened with severity of neuropathy, but none reliably distinguished diabetic patients with and without CTS. CONCLUSIONS - Given the high prevalence of CTS in patients with DPN and that electrodiagnostic criteria cannot distinguish those with clinical CTS, it is recommended that therapeutic decisions for CTS be made independently of electrodiagnostic findings."

The predictive value of clinical and renal histological features for renal outcome in patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated glomerulonephritis was investigated in a prospective analysis of 96 patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis, and moderate renal involvement (creatinine <500 μmol/L). Methods. The extent of 39 histological features in 96 biopsies (performed at entry in a clinical trial) was scored by two independent observers, according to a standardized protocol. Age, gender, diagnosis, glomerular filtration rate at entry (GFR0), ANCA-specificity, proteinuria, and treatment of these 96 patients were also taken into account. Treatment was standardized and started after the biopsy was performed. Endpoints included renal function at 18 months (GFR18), GFR18 corrected for GFR0 (CORGFR18), and the occurrence of relapse or death. Results. Parameters that most strongly correlated with GFR18 were GFR0 (r = 0.67), interstitial fibrosis (r = -0.45), glomerulosclerosis (r = -0.37), and tubular atrophy (r = -0.36). Parameters that most strongly correlated with CORGFR18 were segmental (r = 0.45) and cellular (r = 0.30) crescents, and fibrinoid necrosis (r = 0.46). None of the clinical and histological features predicted the occurrence of relapse or death. By applying a stepwise linear multiple regression analysis, we designed a formula for the estimation of renal function at 18 months: GFR18 (mL/min) = 17 + 0.71 × GFR0 (mL/min) + 0.34 × fibrinoid necrosis (%) + 0.33 × segmental crescents (%), (r2 = 0.60; standard deviation = 19 mL/min). Our results were independent of diagnosis, ANCA-specificity, and treatment limb. Conclusions. These data suggest that in ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis, GFR0 and predominantly chronic renal lesions are potent predictors of GFR18. Active lesions are associated with renal function recovery and may be reversible. The formula for the estimation of GFR18 shows that a combination of GFR0 and renal histology is a better predictor for GFR18 than GFR0 only."

Time-series analyses show an association between temperature and mortality across a range of less extreme temperatures. In this paper, the authors describe the temperature-mortality association for 11 large eastern US cities in 1973-1994 by estimating the relative risks of mortality using log-linear regression analysis for time-series data and by exploring city characteristics associated with variations in this temperature-mortality relation. Current and recent days' temperatures were the weather components most strongly predictive of mortality, and mortality risk generally decreased as temperature increased from the coldest days to a certain threshold temperature, which varied by latitude, above which mortality risk increased as temperature increased. The authors also found a strong association of the temperature-mortality relation with latitude, with a greater effect of colder temperatures on mortality risk in more-southern cities and of warmer temperatures in more-northern cities. The percentage of households with air conditioners in the south and heaters in the north, which serve as indicators of socioeconomic status of the city population, also predicted weather-related mortality. The model developed in this analysis is potentially useful for projecting the consequences of climate-change scenarios and offering insights into susceptibility to the adverse effects of weather."

The average maximum UHI is weakest in summer and is strong in autumn and winter. Similar to previous studies for other cities, the maximum UHI intensity is more frequently observed in the nightime than in the daytime, decreases with increasing wind speed, and is pronounced for clear skies. A multiple linear regression analysis is performed to relate the maximum UHI to meteorological elements. Four predictors considered in this study are the maximum UHI intensity for the previous day, wind speed, cloudiness, and relative humidity. The previous-day maximum UHI intensity is positively correlated with the maximum UHI, and the wind speed, cloudiness, and relative humidity are negatively correlated with the maximum UHI intensity. Among the four predictors, the previous-day maximum UHI intensity is the most important. The relative importance among the predictors varies depending on time of day and season. A three-layer back-propagation neural network model with the four predictors as input units is constructed to predict the maximum UHI intensity in Seoul, and its performance is compared with that of a multiple linear regression model. For all test datasets, the neural network model improves upon the regression model in predicting the maximum UHI intensity. The improvement of the neural network model upon the regression model is 6.3% for the unstratified test data, is higher in the daytime (6.1%) than in the nightime (3.3%), and ranges from 0.8% in spring to 6.5% in winter."

Multiple linear regression and a mixed-effects model were used, taking into account correlation between repeated measurements and adjusting for relevant confounders. In both sexes, FEV1 and FVC were consistently lower in diabetic individuals, compared with healthy individuals, with an average reduction of ∼8% of the predicted value. Longitudinal analyses showed that the decline of FEV1 and FVC in diabetic individuals was similar to that observed in nondiabetic subjects. It was concluded that although diabetic subjects have, on average, a lower forced expiratory volume in one second and forced vital capacity than individuals without diabetes, this deficit seems not to be progressive in the long term. These observations may be of importance with regard to diabetes treatment with inhaled pulmonary insulin, which is likely to become available within a few years."

Methods: Tumors of the nervous system and pituitary gland diagnosed between 1958 and 1995 among 80 160 atomic bomb survivors were ascertained using the Hiroshima and Nagasaki tumor registries, medical records, and death certificates. Pathologists reviewed slides and medical records to provide histologic diagnoses. Poisson regression analyses were used to characterize radiation effects on tumor incidence, which are expressed as excess relative risk per sievert (ERRSv). All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: A statistically significant dose-related excess of nervous system tumors was observed in the cohort (ERRSv = 1.2, 95% confidence Interval [CI] = 0.6 to 2.1). The highest ERRSv was seen for schwannoma (4.5, 95% CI = 1.9 to 9.2). The risk for all other nervous system tumors as a group is also statistically significantly elevated (ERRSv = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.1 to 1.3). Risk increases, although not statistically significant, were seen for meningiomas (ERRSv = 0.6, 95% CI = -0.01 to 1.8), gliomas (ERRSv = 0.6, 95% CI = -0.2 to 2.0), other nervous system tumors (ERRSv = 0.5, 95% CI = <-0.2 to 2.2), and pituitary tumors (ERRSv = 1.0, 95% CI = <-0.2 to 3.5). The dose-response relationships were linear. For nervous system tumors other than schwannoma, excess risks were higher for men than for women and for those exposed during childhood than for those exposed during adulthood. Conclusions: A statistically significant dose response was observed for all nervous system tumors combined and for schwannoma considered separately, indicating that exposure to even moderate doses (i.e., <1 Sv) of radiation is associated with an elevated incidence of nervous system tumors."

The new specification test compares the difference of the forward (conventional) 2SLS estimator of the coefficient of the right-hand side endogenous variable with the reverse 2SLS estimator of the same unknown parameter when the normalization is changed. Under the null hypothesis that conventional first order asymptotics provide a reliable guide to inference, the two estimates should be very similar. Our test sees whether the resulting difference in the two estimates satisfies the results of second order asymptotic theory. Essentially the same idea is applied to develop another new specification test using second-order unbiased estimators of the type first proposed by Nagar. If the forward and reverse Nagar-type estimators are not significantly different we recommend estimation by LIML, which we demonstrate is the optimal linear combination of the Nagar-type estimators (to second order). We also demonstrate the high degree of similarity for k-class estimators between the approach of Bekker and the Edgeworth expansion approach of Rothenberg. An empirical example and Monte Carlo evidence demonstrate the operation of the new specification test."

That study enrolled pregnant women at the Kaiser-Permanente Medical Facilities, conducted interviews, and drew blood specimens; these specimens were centrifuged and the resulting serum specimens were frozen and placed in long-term storage. For the current investigation, organochlorines were measured by dual-column GC-electron capture detection in specimens collected in 1963-1967 from 399 pregnant women during the second and third trimesters. Using multiple linear regression models adjusted for serum lipids, we evaluated factors predicting concentrations of 11 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners, their sum, and several pesticides and metabolites. Variables evaluated were age, race, place of birth, date of blood draw, body mass index, occupation, past residence on a farm, parity, and duration of pregnancy at blood draw. Concentrations of highly chlorinated PCBs and the sum of the PCBs increased with age. Concentrations of certain PCB congeners, as well as the sum, were significantly higher among nonwhites and increased with calendar date of blood draw. p,p′-DDT and p,p-DDE concentrations were about 50% higher for nonwhites compared with whites and for those born in California or the southeastern United States versus elsewhere in the United States. Higher body mass index was associated with lower concentrations of several PCBs and p,p′-DDE but with higher heptachlor epoxide and DDT levels. The increase in use of PCBs during the 1960s is apparently detectable as increasing concentrations in maternal sera between 1963 and 1967. Marked racial and regional differences in serum pesticide levels were likely caused by geographic variation in previous agricultural and vector-control uses. The relationship to body mass index appears to be complex."

Three components are needed for statistical modelling, an ecological model concerning the ecological theory to be used or tested, a data model concerning the collection and measurement of the data, and a statistical model concerning the statistical theory and methods used. This component framework is reviewed with emphasis on ecological theory. The expected shape of a species response curve to an environmental gradient is a central assumption on which agreement has yet to be reached. The nature of the environmental predictors whether indirect variables, e.g. latitude that have no physiological impact on plants, or direct variables, e.g. temperature also influence the type of response expected. Straight-line relationships between organisms and environment are often used uncritically. Many users of canonical correlation analysis use linear (straight-line) functions to relate ordination axes to variables such as slope and aspect though this is not a necessary part of the method. Some statisticians have used straight lines for species/environment relationships without testing, when evaluating new statistical procedures. Assumptions used in one component often conflict with those in another component. Statistical models can be used to explore ecological theory. Skewed species response curves predominate contrary to the symmetric unimodal curves assumed by some statistical methods. Improvements in statistical modelling can be achieved based on ecological concepts. Examples include incorporating interspecific competition from dominant species; more proximal predictors based on water balance models and spatial autocorrelation procedures to accommodate non-equilibrium vegetation. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The 6-minute walk (6mw) is a well-established measure of aerobic capacity in elders with cardiorespiratory and peripheral vascular disease and may be an accurate measure of functional performance in healthy elders. In mobility-limited elders, a population at risk for disability, impairments in strength and power are predictive of performance-based measures of function. Though commonly utilized as an outcome measure among otherwise healthy mobility-limited elders, it is not clear whether the 6mw best represents a measure of functional limitation, aerobic capacity, or both. Methods. We hypothesized that the 6mw would be strongly representative of performance-based measures of function being determined by impairments in muscle strength and power. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 45 community-dwelling elders with mild to moderate mobility limitations. Results. The 6mw was strongly associated with established functional measures (r = .61-.83; p < .001), but was poorly associated with indirect measures of aerobic capacity (r < .25; p > .05). Multivariate linear regression models demonstrated that impairments in leg strength and power, especially those at the knee and ankle, were predictive of 6mw performance. Conclusions. These findings emphasize the 6mw as a measure of functional limitation among mobility-limited elders without cardiorespiratory or peripheral vascular disease."

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - The DCCT was a multicenter, randomized clinical trial designed to compare intensive and conventional therapies and their relative effects on the development and progression of diabetic complications in patients with type 1 diabetes. Quarterly HbA1c and corresponding seven-point capillary blood glucose profiles (premeal, postmeal, and bedtime) obtained in the DCCT were analyzed to define the relationship between HbA1c and PG. Only data from complete profiles with corresponding HbA1c were used (n = 26,056). Of the 1,441 subjects who participated in the study, 2 were excluded due to missing data. Mean plasma glucose (MPG) was estimated by multiplying capillary blood glucose by 1.11. Linear regression analysis weighted by the number of observations per subject was used to correlate MPG and HbA 1c. RESULTS - Linear regression analysis, using MPG and HbA 1c summarized by patient (n = 1,439), produced a relationship of MPG (mmol/l) = (1.98·HbA1c) - 4.29 or MPG (mg/dl) = (35.6·HbA1c) - 77.3, r = 0.82). Among individual time points, afternoon and evening PG (postlunch, predinner, postdinner, and bedtime) showed higher correlations with HbA1c than the morning time points (prebreakfast, postbreakfast, and prelunch). CONCLUSIONS - We have defined the relationship between HbA1c and PG as assessed in the DCCT. Knowing this relationship can help patients with diabetes and their healthcare providers set day-to-day targets for PG to achieve specific HbA1c goals."

In order to determine whether the neural adaptations to resistance training occur to a greater extent at cortical or subcortical sites in the CNS, we compared the effects of resistance training on the electromyographic (EMG) responses to transcranial magnetic (TMS) and electrical (TES) stimulation. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from the first dorsal interosseous muscle of 16 individuals before and after 4 weeks of resistance training for the index finger abductors (n=8), or training involving finger abduction-adduction without external resistance (n = 8). TMS was delivered at rest at intensities from 5% below the passive threshold to the maximal output of the stimulator. TMS and TES were also delivered at the active threshold intensity while the participants exerted torques ranging from 5 to 60% of their maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) torque. The average latency of MEPs elicited by TES was significantly shorter than that of TMS MEPs (TES latency = 21.5 ± 1.4 ms; TMS latency = 23.4 ± 1.4 ms; P < 0.05), which indicates that the site of activation differed between the two forms of stimulation. Training resulted in a significant increase in MVC torque for the resistance-training group, but not the control group. There were no statistically significant changes in the corticospinal properties measured at rest for either group. For the active trials involving both TMS and TES, however, the slope of the relationship between MEP size and the torque exerted was significantly lower after training for the resistance-training group (P < 0.05). Thus, for a specific level of muscle activity, the magnitude of the EMG responses to both forms of transcranial stimulation were smaller following resistance training. These results suggest that resistance training changes the functional properties of spinal cord circuitry in humans, but does not substantially affect the organisation of the motor cortex."

Methods: A cross sectional survey of the semen of 503 men employed by 10 companies was conducted in the United Kingdom, Italy, and Belgium. The mean blood lead concentration was 31.0 μg/dl (range 4.6-64.5) in 362 workers exposed to lead and 4.4 μg/dl (range below the detection limit of 19.8) in 141 reference workers. Semen volume and sperm concentration were determined in a fresh semen sample according to an agreed protocol subject to quality assurance. The sperm chromatin structure assay (SCSA) was performed at a centralised laboratory. Extraneous determinants including centre, period of sexual abstinence, and age were taken into account in the statistical analysis. If appropriate, possible thresholds were examined by iterative threshold slope linear regression. Results: The median sperm concentration was reduced by 49% in men with blood lead concentration above 50 μg/dl. There was no indication of a linear trend of lower sperm concentration with increasing blood lead values, but threshold slope least square regression identified a blood lead concentration of 44 μg/dl (β=-0.037, F=4.35, p=0.038) as a likely threshold. Abnormal sperm chromatin structure was not related to blood lead concentration, but some indications of deterioration of sperm chromatin was found in men with the highest concentrations of lead within spermatozoa. Biological monitoring data did not indicate long term effects of lead on semen quantity or sperm chromatin. Conclusion: Adverse effects of lead on sperm concentration and susceptibility to acid induced denaturation of sperm chromatin are unlikely at blood lead concentrations below 45 μg/dl. Effects of low level exposure to lead on other measures of testicular function cannot be ruled out."

Methods: Preoperative and 2 year follow up data were submitted to the Swedish Corneal Transplant Register by surgeons in eight corneal transplant clinics in Sweden. Preoperative data on 1957 grafts and 520 grafts with 2 year follow up were included in the analysis. Data were analysed by multiple linear and logistic regression methods, as appropriate. Results: The major diagnostic categories were keratoconus (29%), bullous keratopathy (21%), and ""other diagnosis"" (32%). Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy and stromal dystrophies accounted for 15% and 3% of grafts, respectively. At 2 years the overall incidence of complications, other than rejection and regrafting, was 26%, with an increasing frequency from keratoconus < Fuchs' dystrophy < bullous keratopathy < ""other diagnosis."" Rejection was observed in 15% of grafts and was more likely in the bullous keratopathy (OR 3.1, 95% Cl 1.1 to 9.0, p=O.04) and ""other diagnosis"" (OR 2.6, 95% Cl 1.1 to 5.9, p=0.03) groups. Regrafting, which occurred in 10% af cases, was not influenced by diagnosis, but it was related to the incidence of rejection (OR 14.8, 95% Cl 6.1 to 35.9, p<0.001) and other complications (OR 4.4, 95% Cl 1.9 to 10.4, p=0.001), and to the presence of other sight threatening pathology in the eye (OR 3.6, 95% Cl 1.3 to 9.9, p=0.01). Visual acuity was improved in a high proportion of the patients, especially those with keratoconus and Fuchs' dystrophy where, respectively, 86% and 54% of grafts achieved a visual acuity of ≥0.5 at 2 years, compared with only 31% with bullous keratopathy and 35% in the ""other diagnosis"" group. 60% of grafts for keratoconus and Fuchs' dystrophy achieved a visual acuity equal to or better than the other eye. Postoperative astigmatism was higher in the bullous keratopathy (p=0.01) group. Patients with high astigmatism benefited from refractive surgery, showing a reduction from 7.9 (95%Cl 6.9, 8.7) to 3.2 (95% Cl 2.6, 3.9) dioptres (p<0.001). A centre effect was evident in visual outcome. Conclusion: The overall incidence of complications was related to diagnosis. Complications other than rejection and regrafting were most likely in the ""other diagnosis group, and further analysis of this group is therefore planned. The best improvement in visual acuity and the lowest astigmatism were achieved in the keratoconus and Fuchs' dystrophy groups; but the influence of diagnosis on astigmatism was small and, overall, the statistical model accounted for only 8% of the variability in astigmatism. Refractive surgery was, however, effective in reducing astigmatism. It is hoped that a better understanding of the factors that determine the visual outcome of grafts will emerge from future analyses of the Swedish Corneal Transplant Register, helping to refine the criteria for patient selection and to guide clinical practice."

The relationship between volume status and blood pressure (BP) in chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients remains incompletely understood. Specifically, the effect of interdialytic fluid accumulation (or intradialytic fluid removal) on BP is controversial. Methods. We determined the association of the intradialytic decrease in body weight (as an indicator of interdialytic fluid gain) and the intradialytic decrease in plasma volume (as an indicator of postdialysis volume status) with predialysis and postdialysis BP in a cross-sectional analysis of a subset of patients (N = 468) from the Hemodialysis (HEMO) Study. Fifty-five percent of patients were female, 62% were black, 43% were diabetic and 72% were prescribed antihypertensive medications. Dry weight was defined as the postdialysis body weight below which the patient developed symptomatic hypotension or muscle cramps in the absence of edema. The intradialytic decrease in plasma volume was calculated from predialysis and postdialysis total plasma protein concentrations and was expressed as a percentage of the plasma volume at the beginning of HD. Results. Predialysis systolic and diastolic BP values were 153.1 ± 24.7 (mean ± SD) and 81.7 ± 14.8 mm Hg, respectively; postdialysis systolic and diastolic BP values were 136.6 ± 22.7 and 73.9 ± 13.6 mm Hg, respectively. As a result of HD, body weight was reduced by 3.1 ± 1.3 kg and plasma volume was contracted by 10.1 ± 9.5%. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that each kg reduction in body weight during HD was associated with a 2.95 mm Hg (P = 0.004) and a 1.65 mm Hg (P = NS) higher predialysis and postdialysis systolic BP, respectively. In contrast, each 5% greater contraction of plasma volume during HD was associated with a 1.50 mm Hg (P = 0.026) and a 2.56 mm Hg (P < 0.001) lower predialysis and postdialysis systolic BP, respectively. The effects of intradialytic decreases in body weight and plasma volume were greater on systolic BP than on diastolic BP. Conclusions. HD treatment generally reduces BP, and these reductions in BP are associated with intradialytic decreases in both body weight and plasma volume. The absolute predialysis and postdialysis BP levels are influenced differently by acute intradialytic decreases in body weight and acute intradialytic decreases in plasma volume; these parameters provide different information regarding volume status and may be dissociated from each other. Therefore, evaluation of volume status in chronic HD patients requires, at minimum, assessments of both interdialytic fluid accumulation (or the intradialytic decrease in body weight) and postdialysis volume overload."

The present study sought to evaluate the relative role of early adverse experience vs. stress experiences in adulthood in the prediction of neuroendocrine stress reactivity in women. A total of 49 women (normal volunteers, depressed patients, and women with a history of early abuse) underwent a battery of interviews and completed dimensional rating scales on stress experiences and psychopathology, and were subsequently exposed to a standardized psychosocial laboratory stressor. Outcome measures were plasma adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and cortisol responses to the stress test. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to identify the impact of demographic variables, childhood abuse, adulthood trauma, major life events in the past year, and daily hassles in the past month, as well as psychopathology on hormonal stress responsiveness. Peak ACTH responses to psychosocial stress were predicted by a history of childhood abuse, the number of separate abuse events, the number of adulthood traumas, and the severity of depression. Similar predictors were identified for peak cortisol responses. Although abused women reported more severe negative life events in adulthood than controls, life events did not affect neuroendocrine reactivity. The regression model explained 35% of the variance of ACTH responses. The interaction of childhood abuse and adulthood trauma was the most powerful predictor of ACTH responsiveness. Our findings suggest that a history of childhood abuse per se is related to increased neuroendocrine stress reactivity, which is further enhanced when additional trauma is experienced in adulthood. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

We collected data on 20 neurobehavioral tests in 529 former organolead workers who had an average of 16 years since last occupational exposure to lead. We used linear regression to model the relations between each of 20 neurobehavioral test scores and tibia lead, a binary variable for ApoE genotype (i.e., at least one ε4 allele vs. none), and an interaction term between tibia lead and the binary term for ApoE genotype. At the time of testing, former lead workers were an average of 57.6 years of age; 82% were younger than 65 years. In regression analysis, we observed one statistically significant and one borderline significant coefficient for ApoE genotype alone. Coefficients for the ApoE and tibia lead interaction term were negative in 19 of the 20 regression models.

Four of 19 negative coefficients for the interaction term were statistically significant (digit symbol, Purdue pegboard assembly, Purdue pegboard-dominant hand, complex reaction time); another three of the remaining 16 coefficients (symbol digit, trail-making A, Stroop) were borderline significant (i.e., p < 0.10). This study suggests that individuals may vary in susceptibility to the long-term effects of lead on the central nervous system (CNS). In particular, the persistent CNS effect of lead may be more toxic in individuals who have at least one ApoE-ε4 allele."

The chemical information however is distributed differently in each set with the Abraham set incorporating extra information in the excess molar refraction descriptor E. Regression equations have been constructed to predict the experimental Abraham descriptors from theoretically calculated COSMOments. The chemical interpretation of these equations is however difficult because of the lack of clustering which characterizes the distribution of chemical information through the two sets of descriptors. The predictability of the regression equations is tested successfully using a reasonably large set of data, and the method is compared to recent attempts to calculate the Abraham descriptors from various theoretical bases."

The decline of physical function of older adults, associated with loss of independent living status, is a major public health concern. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of physical impairment and disability to performance of activities of daily living (ADL) among community-dwelling older adults. Subjects and Methods. Eighty-three community-dwelling older men who were referred to a comprehensive outpatient geriatric evaluation program (mean age=75.5 years, SD=7.0, range=64-97) were examined. Measurements of physical impairment (muscle force production, flexibility, and fitness) and physical disability (gait speed, stride length, risk for recurrent falls, and physical function) were recorded. Results. A stepwise linear regression was used to determine the relationship of physical impairments and disability measures with ADL. The results indicated that walking speed, fall risk, and muscle force contributed independently to the characterization of the activities of daily living of the community-dwelling older men studied (adjusted R2=.68; F=56.81; df=3,80; P<.001). Using a principal components factor analysis, 4 domains were identified that explained 68.2% of the variance in performance of ADL: (1) mobility/fall risk=26.5%, (2) coordination=15%, (3) fitness=14.7%, and (4) flexibility=12.0%. Discussion and Conclusion. The identification of domains of physical function may be useful to physical therapists in the development of interventions targeted for physical impairments and disabilities that contribute to deficits in performance of ADL. Targeting interventions for physical impairments and disabilities related to function may improve the effectiveness of physical therapist interventions and reduce the loss of independence among community-dwelling older people."

In order to identify patients who would benefit from prophylactic amtiemetics, six predictive models have been described for the risk assessment of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). This study compared the validity and practicability of these models in patients undergoing general anaesthesia. Methods. Data were analysed from 1566 patients who underwent balanced anaesthesia without prophylactic antiemetic treatment for various types of surgery. A systematic literature search identified six predictive models for PONV. These models were compared with respect to validity (discriminating power and calibration characteristics) and practicability. Discriminating power was measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration was assessed by weighted linear regression analysis between predicted and actual incidences of PONV. Practicability was assessed according to the number of factors to be considered for the model (the fewer factors the better), and whether the score could be used in combination with a previously applied cost-effective concept. Results. The incidence of PONV was 600/1566 (38.1%). The discriminating power (AUC) obtained by the models (named according to the first author) using the risk classes from the recommended prophylactic concept were as follows: Apfel, 0.68; Koivuranta, 0.66; Sinclair, 0.66; Palazzo, 0.63; Gan, 0.61; Scholz, 0.61. For four models, the following calibration curves (expressed as the slope and the offset) were plotted: Apfel, y=0.82x+0.01, r2=0.995; Koivuranta, y=1.13x-0.10, r2=0.999; Sinclair, y=0.49x+0.29, r2=0.789; Palazzo, y=0.30x+0.30, r2=0.763. The numbers of parameters to be considered were as follows: Apfel, 4; Koivuranta, 5; Palazzo, 5; Scholz, 9; Sinclair, 12; Gan, 14. Conclusion. The simplified risk scores provided better discrimination and calibration properties compared with the more complex risk scores. Therefore, simplified risk scores can be recommended for antiemetic strategies in clinical practice as well as for group comparisons in randomized controlled antiemetic trials."

Objective: The aim of the present study was to determine the relative importance for maturation of the visual cortex of the dietary supply of LCPs during the first 6 wk of life compared with that during weeks 7-52. Design: A randomized controlled clinical trial of LCP supplementation in 65 healthy term infants who were weaned from breast-feeding at 6 wk of age was conducted to determine whether the dietary supply of LCPs after weaning influenced the maturation of visual acuity and stereoacuity. Results: Despite a dietary supply of LCPs from breast milk during the first 6 wk of life, infants who were weaned to formula that did not provide LCPs had significantly poorer visual acuity at 17, 26, and 52 wk of age and significantly poorer stereoacuity at 17 wk of age than did infants who were weaned to LCPsupplemented formula. Better acuity and stereoacuity at 17 wk was correlated with higher concentrations of docosahexaenoic acid in plasma. Better acuity at 52 wk was correlated with higher concentrations of docosahexaenoic acid in plasma and red blood cells. No significant effects of diet on growth were found. Conclusion: The results suggest that the critical period during which the dietary supply of LCPs can influence the maturation of cortical function extends beyond 6 wk of age."

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - A previous cross-sectional study assessed the relationship between marital quality and adaptation to diabetes for 78 insulin-treated adults. Each participant completed two marital quality measures (Spanier Dyadic Adjustment Scale and Personal Assessment of Intimacy in Relationships Scale) at time 1 (T1). A total of 61 subjects were contacted two years later (time 2 [T2]) and re-administered four HRQoL measures (Diabetes Quality of Life Scale, Medical Outcomes Study Health Survey-SF36, Problem Areas in Diabetes Scale, and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule). Glycemic control was assessed by HbA1c. Demographic data (age, sex, type and duration of diabetes, years married, other medical problems, family history, and years of education) were gathered from charts and questionnaires. Linear regression analyses were used to assess the ability of the two marital measures at T1 to predict HRQoL at T2, controlling for confounding HRQoL and baseline subject variables. RESULTS - Both of the marital quality measures at T1 were prospective predictors of aspects of HRQoL at T2. Less diabetes-related distress at T2 was predicted by better marital adjustment at T1. Greater satisfaction with aspects of the diabetes care regimen at T2 was predicted by better marital adjustment and greater perceived marital intimacy at T1. Neither marital measure predicted general HRQoL or glycemic control. CONCLUSIONS - For insulin-treated adults with diabetes, quality of marriage prospectively predicts diabetes-related quality of life. This study highlights the sensitivity of diabetes-specific measures. Future work should explore the value of interventions that target the spouse and/or couple."

Near-infrared spectroscopy, a noninvasive bedside technology has potential, although thresholds for cerebral hypoxia-ischemia have not been defined. This study determined hypoxic-ischemic thresholds for cerebral oxygen saturation (Sco2) in terms of EEG, brain ATP, and lactate concentrations, and compared these values with CBF and sagittal sinus oxygen saturation (Svo2). Sixty anesthetized piglets were equipped with near-infrared spectroscopy, EEG, laser-Doppler flowmetry, and a sagittal sinus catheter. After baseline, Sco2 levels of less than 20%, 20% to 29%, 30% to 39%, 40% to 49%, 50% to 59%, 60% to 79%, or 80% or greater were recorded for 30 minutes of normoxic normocapnia, hypercapnic hyperoxia, or bilateral carotid occlusion with or without arterial hypoxia. Brain ATP and lactate concentrations were measured biochemically. Logistic and linear regression determined the Sco2 CBF, and Svo2 thresholds for abnormal EEG, ATP, and lactate findings. Baseline Sco2 was 68 + 5%. The Sco2 thresholds for increased lactate, minor and major EEG change, and decreased ATP were 44 ± 1%, 42 ± 5%, 37 ± 1%, and 33 ± 1%. The Sco2 correlated linearly with Svo2 (r = 0.98) and CBF (r = 0.89), with corresponding Svo2 thresholds of 23%, 20%, 13%, and 8%, and CBF thresholds (% baseline) of 56%, 52%, 42%, and 36%. Thus, cerebral hypoxia-ischemia near-infrared spectroscopy thresholds for functional impairment are Sco2 33% to 44%, a range that is well below baseline Sco2 of 68%, suggesting a buffer between normal and dysfunction that also exists for CBF and Svo2."

This study was carried out in response to community concerns about potential health effects of exposure to diesel exhaust particulate (DEP). We measured particulate matter < 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) and elemental carbon (EC) on sidewalks and tested whether spatial variations in concentrations were related to local truck traffic density. Ten-hour integrated air samples for EC and PM2.5 were collected for 9 days over a 3-week period in the summer of 1999 at seven geographically distinct intersections. Simultaneous traffic counts were carried out for each sampling event. Traffic was classified into three classes: passenger cars, small trucks, and large trucks (diesel vehicles). Mean diesel vehicle volumes ranged from 9.3 to 276.5 vehicles/hr across sites. Mean EC concentrations by site ranged from 2.6 μg/m3 at the control site to 7.3 μg/m3 along a designated truck route. Linear regression of site-specific mean EC concentration o mean large truck counts predicted an increase of 1.69 μg/m3 EC per 100 large trucks/hr (SE = 0.37; p = 0.01; R2 = 0.84). Average PM2.5 concentrations by site ranged 1.6-fold (19.0-29.9 μg/m3) and were more weakly associated with local traffic. Variations over time for PM2.5 were more pronounced, ranging almost 4-fold (8.9-34.4 μg/m3). These results show that airbone EC concentrations, an important component of DEP, are elevated in Hunts Point and that the impact varies across the community as a function of large truck traffic."

This paper reports an ecological analysis that evaluated whether population health was associated with general practitioner (GP) supply in England. Methods: Data were analysed for 99 health authorities in England in 1999. Health outcomes included standardized mortality ratios, infant mortality rate (per 1000), hospital admissions with acute and chronic conditions (per 100000), and teenage conception rates (per 1000). The number of GPs per 10 000 population was included as explanatory variable. Confounders included the Townsend deprivation score, proportion of ethnic minorities, proportion in social classes IV and V, and proportion with limiting long-term illness. Analyses were by linear regression weighted for population size. Results: Higher GP supply was associated with lower mortality in univariate analyses. After adjusting for deprivation score, ethnic group and social class, the standardized mortality ratio for all-cause mortality at 15-64 years decreased by -5.2 (95 per cent confidence interval -8.3 to -2.0, p = 0.002) per unit increase in GP supply. After additional adjustment for limiting long-term illness, the decrease was -3.3 (-6.7 to 0.1, p = 0.060). In the fully adjusted model, each unit increase in GP supply was associated with a decrease in hospital admission rates for acute conditions (-14.4, -21.4 to -7.4 per 100000, p < 0.001) and chronic conditions (-10.6, -17.2 to -4.0, p = 0.002). Conclusions: In England, lower supply of GPs was associated with increased hospital utilization, but a strong univariate association with mortality might be explained by confounding."

Methods: In a secondary analysis of a representative cohort of Canadians aged 65 and over (n = 2914) we estimated a frailty index based on the proportion of 20 deficits observed in a structured clinical examination. The construct validity of the index was examined through its relationship to chronological age (CA). The criterion validity was examined in its ability to predict mortality, and in relation to other predictions about aging. From the frailty index, relative (to CA) fitness and frailty were estimated, as was an individual's biological age. Results: The average value of the frailty index increased with age in a log-linear relationship (r = 0.91; p < 0.001). In a Cox regression analysis, biological age was significantly more highly associated with death than chronological age. The average increase in the frailty index (i.e. the average accumulation of deficits) amongst those with no cognitive impairment was 3 per cent per year. Conclusions: The frailty index is a sensitive predictor of survival. As the index includes items not traditionally related to adverse health outcomes, the finding is compatible with a view of frailty as the failure to integrate the complex responses required to maintain function."

On the other hand, decreased dopaminergic tone in humans is well correlated with obesity. The objective of this study was to correlate changes in prolactin levels with leptin and body mass index (BMI) in patients with prolactinomas treated with the long-acting dopamine agonist bromocriptine (BC). Methods: Eleven female and twelve male patients, aged 36.7±2.6 years with BMI in males of 30.4± 1.7 kg/m2 and in females of 24.4±1.2 kg/m2, were evaluated after 1 and 6 months and 11 patients were further evaluated after 2 years of BC therapy. Plasma prolactin is presented as the mean of four samples taken daily. Serum leptin was determined in the pooled serum from three samples taken at 15-min intervals at 0800 h after an overnight fast. Multivariate linear regression and repeated measures analysis of covariance were used. Results: In males, pretreatment prolactin levels were 71 362±29 912 mU/l while leptin levels were 14.9±1.8 μg/l. In females, pretreatment prolactin levels were 11 395±5839 mU/l and leptin levels were 16.7±2.5 μg/l. The sexual dimorphism of serum leptin levels at initial presentation was preserved after adjusting for BMI and prolactin-induced hypogonadism. After 1 month of therapy, prolactin levels significantly decreased (males: 17 618±8736 mU/l, females: 3686±2231; P < 0.05), BMI did not change (males: 30.2±1.7 kg/m2, females: 24.1±1.2 kg/m2; P > 0.05), while serum leptin levels decreased (males: 12.5±1.5 μg/l, females: 13.6±2.1 μg/l; P < 0.05). After 6 months of treatment, prolactin further decreased (males: 3456±2101 mU/l, females: 677±360 mU/l; P < 0.05) as did BMI (males: 28.6±1.6 kg/m2, females 23.1±1.0 kg/m2; P < 0.05). The difference was more pronounced in male patients. Leptin levels were 12.8± 2.8 μg/l in males and 12.9±1.8 μg/l in females (P < 0.05). After 2 years of BC treatment, prolactin levels were near normal (males: 665±439 mU/l, females 447±130 mU/l; P < 0.05) and BMI remained 26.5±1.9 kg/m2 for males and 23.6±0.8 kg/m2 for females (P < 0.05). Leptin levels were 9.5±2.2 μg/l in males and 18.7±3.1 μg/l in females (P < 0.05). There was a gradual increase in the gender difference in serum leptin levels over time. Changes in serum leptin levels significantly correlated with changes in BMI (r = 0.844, P < 0.001) but did not correlate with changes in plasma prolactin levels after 1 month (r = 0.166), 6 months (r = 0.313) and 2 years (r = 0.234, P > 0.05). Conclusion: The long-acting dopamine agonist BC, by increasing dopaminergic tone, may influence body weight and likely body composition by mechanisms in addition to reducing hyperprolactinemia in patients with prolactinomas."

This study is designed to determine a formula predicting total liver volume (TLV) based on body surface area (BSA) or body weight in Western adults. TLV was measured in 292 patients from four Western centers. Liver volumes were calculated from helical computed tomographic scans obtained for conditions unrelated to the hepatobiliary system. BSA was calculated based on height and weight. Each center used a different established method of three-dimensional volume reconstruction. Using regression analysis, measurements were compared, and formulas correlating BSA or body weight to TLV were established. A linear regression formula to estimate TLV based on BSA was obtained: TLV = -794.41 + 1,267.28 × BSA (square meters; r2 = 0.46; P <.0001). A formula based on patient weight also was derived: TLV = 191.80 + 18.51 × weight (kilograms; r2 = 0.49; P <.0001). The newly derived TLV formula based on BSA was compared with previously reported formulas. The application of a formula obtained from healthy Japanese individuals underestimated TLV. Two formulas derived from autopsy data for Western populations were similar to the newly derived BSA formula, with a slight overestimation of TLV. In conclusion, hepatic three-dimensional volume reconstruction based on helical CT predicts TLV based on BSA or body weight. The new formulas derived from this correlation should contribute to the estimation of TLV before liver transplantation or major hepatic resection."

To examine the predictive factors for anxiety, depression and pain in adults with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Patients and Methods. Two hundred and forty-six adults identified with long-standing JIA had an average disease duration of 28.3 yr. Candidate factors potentially predictive for pain, anxiety and depression were assessed by multiple regression analysis. Results. Of the patients, 31.6% were anxious, 5.2% were depressed, and 21.1% had previously suffered from depression. The percentage of the variance accounted for by other variables was 78.8 for anxiety variance and 54.5 for depression, but there was little influence from physical disease-related factors. Severe pain, measured on a visual analogue scale, occurred in 32.9% of patients, and 22.8% had poor perceived control over their pain. Function, coping strategies, pain self-efficacy, inflammation and previous depression could predict 39.6% of the variance in pain. Conclusions. Comparing adults with children, disease activity and control over pain remain predictors of pain but become less important than disability and coping strategies."

Methods: 50 healthy volunteers (25 women, mean age 33.6 (9.5) years, range 19-59 years) took part. Each subject underwent serial 12 lead electrocardiographic monitoring over 24 hours with a 10 second ECG obtained every two minutes. QT intervals and heart rates were measured automatically. In each subject, the QT/RR relation was modelled using six generic regressions, including a linear model (QT = β + α × RR), a hyperbolic model (QT = β + α/RR), and a parabolic model (QT = β × RRα). For each model, the parallelism and identity of the regression lines in separate subjects were statistically tested. Results: The patterns of the QT/RR relation were very different among subjects. Regardless of the generic form of the regression model, highly significant differences were found not only between the regression lines but also between their slopes. For instance, with the linear model, the individual slope (parameter α) of any subject differed highly significantly (p < 0.000001) from the linear slope of no fewer than 21 (median 32) other subjects. The linear regression line of 20 subjects differed significantly (p < 0.000001) from the linear regression lines of each other subject. Conversion of the QT/RR regressions to QTc heart rate correction also showed substantial intersubject differences. Optimisation of the formula QTc: QT/RRα led to individual values of α ranging from 0.234 to 0.486. Conclusion: The QT/RR relation exhibits a very substantial intersubject variability in healthy volunteers. The hypothesis underlying each prospective heart rate correction formula that a ""physiological"" QT/RR relation exists that can be mathematically described and applied to all people is incorrect. Any general heart rate correction formula can be used only for very approximate clinical assessment of the QTc interval over a narrow window of resting heart rates. For detailed precise studies of the QTc interval (for example, drug induced QT interval prolongation), the individual QT/RR relation has to be taken into account."

Getis' filtering approach is based on the autocorrelation observed with the use of the G1 local statistic. Griffith's approach uses an eigenfunction decomposition based on the geographic connectivity matrix used to compute a Moran's I statistic. Economic data are used to compare the workings of the two approaches. A final comparison with an autoregressive model strengthens the conclusion that both techniques are effective filtering devices, and that they yield similar regression models.

Determinants of inter-individual variation in blood pressure (BP) response to antihypertensive therapy remain largely unknown. Although differences in race, age and measures of the renin-angiotensin-aldostcrone system (RAAS) have been associated with variation in blood pressure response to hydrochlorothiazide, whether these characteristics make additive contributions to predicting response has not been established. We conducted a comprehensive search for predictors of BP response to a standard dose of hydrochlorothiazide in a biracial sample to estimate how much inter-individual variation in BP response could be explained by all of the identified predictors. Methods. After withdrawal of antihypertensive medications for at least four weeks (baseline) and stabilization on a diet approximating 150 mmol sodium per day, 225 African American and 280 Caucasian subjects with diagnosed essential hypertension were treated for four weeks with hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg per day. At baseline and the end of treatment, subjects were admitted to the General Clinical Research Center for measurement of activity of the RAAS and other regulators of BP. Characteristics measured at study enrollment, at baseline, and in response to drug treatment were incorporated stepwise into linear regression models in order to quantify their additive contributions to predicting BP responses to hydrochlorothiazide. Results. Black race and female gender were both associated with significantly greater systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure responses to hydrochlorothiazide. Together the combined effects of race and gender accounted for 11% inter-individual variation in SBP response (P < 0.0001) and 4% of inter-individual variation in DBP response (P < 0.0001). Additional statistically significant predictors of greater systolic and diastolic responses to hydrochlorothiazide included, shorter duration of diagnosed or treated hypertension (P < 0.001), higher baseline BP level (P < 0.0001), lower baseline plasma renin activity (P < 0.05), lower baseline urinary aldosterone excretion (P < 0.002), and greater decrease in urinary sodium excretion (P ≤ 0.004). Greater decrease in weight was an additionai statistically significant predictor of SBP but not DBP response, and older age was a predictor of diastolic but not SBP response. The combined effects of all identified predictors accounted for 38% of inter-individual variation in SBP response (P < 0.0001) and 20% of inter-individuai variation in DBP response (P < 0.0001). Conclusions. A systematic search reveals numerous predictors of BP response to a standard antihypertensive dose of hydrochlorothiazide. However, because the majority of interindividual variation in SBP and DBP responses remains unexplained, there is considerable opportunity for future investigations to improve the ability to predict individual BP responses to antihypertensive drug therapy."

In this strategy, a cross-validation procedure first screens out all models that perform poorly on independent data. then the error variance of every remaining model is compared to that of every other model to test whether the difference in error variances is statistically significant. This strategy is shown to produce better forecasts on average than selecting either the model that utilizes all predictors, the model that explains the most variance in the independent data, or the model with the most favorable statistics suggested by Mallow. All of the model selection criteria suggest that regression models based on two to three predictors produce better forecasts on average than regression models using a larger number of predictors. For the period up to 1967, the forecast strategy selected the prior climatology as the best predictor. For the period 1967 to the present, the strategy performed better than forecasts based on the prior climatology and all other methodologies investigated. Indexes of Pacific Ocean temperature in the Tropics (called Niño-3) and indexes of pressure fluctuations in the Northern Atlantic (called NAO), at 1-6 lead months, failed to provide prediction models that performed better on average than a prediction based on the antecedent climatology. Forecasts based on the prior 25-yr climatology had especially high skill during the recent period 1989-2000. a fact that appears to be a mere coincidence, but which may be relevant to interpreting the skill of the power regression model currently used by the India Meteorological Department."

Methods. Data on food frequency consumption (FFC), serum lipids, and other covariates were available for a representative sample of 1,045 adults. A 12-month retrospective food frequency questionnaire was used. FFC was assessed using scores of consumption, which was obtained by grouping food according to their composition into two large groups: score I (known as risk food for cardiovascular diseases) and score II (known as healthy food). The association between the scores and serum blood lipoprotein levels among the study population was analyzed through multiple linear regression analyses. Modeling step-wise techniques were used to enter the covariates into the linear models. Results. Increasing mean levels of TOTAL-C and LDL-C were seen from the lowest through the highest quintile of score I when compared to the score II, where decreasing mean levels of TOTAL-C and LDL-C were observed from the lowest to the highest quintile. The results of the linear regression analyses between serum TOTAL-C and LDL-C levels for both FFC score I and score II, after multivariate adjusting, showed a significant positive relationship with score I and a significant and inverse relationship with score II. Conclusions. In population studies, FFC analyses through scores can be the choice method to evaluate the quality of diet and its potential effect on serum levels of TOTAL-C and LDL-C."

We hypothesized that the FEV1/FEV6, would predict the subsequent decline in FEV1 in adult cigarette smokers who enrolled in the multicenter Lung Health Study. Ten clinical centers in the U.S. and Canada recruited 5887 male and female smokers, aged 35-60 years, with borderline to mild airways obstruction by spirometry. Those who successfully stopped smoking during the 5-yr study (usually as the result of the smoking cessation intervention) were excluded from this analysis. In those continuing to smoke, the relative strength of spirometric predictors of the change in FEV1 during 5 years of follow-up (DFEV1) was determined using a linear regression model. The following covariates were significant independent predictors of DFEV1: the baseline degree of airways obstruction, age, gender, cigarettes per day, years of education, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. The FEV1/FEV6 was nearly as strong an independent predictor as was the FEV1/FVC (a traditional index of airways obstruction). The degree of airways obstruction, as determined by the FEV1/FEV6 from spirometry, is an independent predictor of subsequent decline in lung function; and therefore, may be used to detect smokers at higher risk of developing COPD. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd."

Conducted in the United States in 1988-1994 among adults aged ≥17 years, this survey measured serum lipids, FEV1, and confounding factors including smoking and antioxidants. Multiple linear regression analysis explored the relation of FEV1/height2 to low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and their respective apolipoproteins (apo) B and A-I.

A geographic analysis of the relationship between within-country differences in the prevalence of M-type resistance to erythromycin in S. pyogenes and the level of consumption of 14- and 15-membered macrolides within different provinces was carried out. From 1998 to 1999, a nationwide multicenter surveillance study yielded 2,039 consecutive pharyngeal isolates of S. pyogenes. Data on antibiotic consumption for the same period were gathered from IMS Health, and the corresponding daily defined doses per 1,000 inhabitants per day were calculated according to the Anatomic Therapeutic Classification index. Macrolide use was subdivided into dosages given three times a day (TID), twice a day (BID), or once a day (OD). Spearman nonparametric correlation coefficients (R) were calculated, and variables proving to be significantly associated (P < 0.1) were introduced into a linear regression model. The total consumption of macrolides presented a significant correlation with the prevalence of resistance (R = 0.527; P = 0.032). Neither TID nor BID macrolide consumption showed significant correlations. Only OD consumption had a significance below 0.1. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that only the total consumption of macrolides influences the local rates of M-type erythromycin resistance in S. pyogenes, and subgroups of macrolides seem to have an additive rather than a selective effect by contributing to increasing the final amount of macrolides used. Local variations in total consumption were associated only with BID consumption (R = 0.849; P = 0.004). The simple linear regression with total macrolide consumption showed a considerable determination coefficient (R2= 0.678; P = 0.006). The model explains up to 68% of the measured variation and is clearly better as a predictor of the prevalence of resistance than the mere mean is. By solving the regression equation, the resultant value of 2.2 defined doses per 1,000 inhabitants per day fits with the existence of a critical threshold of selective pressure."

Methods: The study population was 6252 patients with a myocardial infarction admitted alive from 1990 to 1992. The mortality status was obtained after at least 6 years. Results: Cox proportional-hazards model demonstrated that the unadjusted risk ratio associated with a calculated creatinine clearance ≤40 ml . min-1 compared to a clearance above 85 ml . min-1 was 7·1(95% confidence interval 6·2-8·0). Adjustment for multiple available covariates reduced this risk to 2·0(1·6-2·4). The unadjusted risk ratio associated with clearance from 41 to 55 ml . min-1 and from 71 to 85 ml . min-1 was 3·7(3·3-4·2) and 1·5 (1·3-1·7) respectively, but after adjustment for all available variables these risks were reduced to 1·4(1·2-1·6) and 1·1(0·9-1·3) respectively. Conclusion: Renal dysfunction is an important risk factor after acute myocardial infarction. When the risk is adjusted for available competing risk factors only severely reduced renal function is associated with an important and independent risk of mortality after acute myocardial infarction. The risk of a moderate reduction in renal function is almost fully explained by an association with other conditions. © 2002 The European Society of Cardiology. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Together with the mean fields, 11 EOFs are capable of representing 68% of the squared electric field in the original data, leaving only a fairly random component as a residual. While such mathematically independent EOFs do not necessarily represent physically independent modes of variability, each of the first two EOFs is actually related to a widely known physically prominent effect on the convection patterns. Variability associated with the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) BY component emerges as the primary mode, and variability associated with the IMF BZ effect emerges as the secondary mode. The tertiary mode reflects variability in the cusp region, but is not significantly correlated with the IMF."

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of central adiposity in the association between overweight, high BP, and insulin resistance. Methods: A total of 1079 men participated in the follow-up of the Olivetti Heart Study from 1994 to 1995. The present analysis includes 768 men, after the exclusion of 184 participants on pharmacological treatment for hypertension. In 65 men fasting blood glucose was >7 mmol/L; in 48, age was below or above 2 standard deviations from the mean of the population; and in 14 the data set was incomplete. Anthropometric indices of adiposity, metabolic variables (including fasting serum insulin and homeostasis model assessment [HOMA] index of insulin sensitivity), and BP were measured. Results: In univariate analysis, waist circumference was the anthropometric index that best correlated with BP (P < .001). In multiple regression analysis, waist circumference remained the strongest independent predictor of BP after adjustment for confounders. Significant increase of systolic (P value for trend analysis < .001) and diastolic (P < .001) pressure, heart rate (P = .003), fasting and postload serum insulin (P < .001), and HOMA index of insulin sensitivity (P < .001) were observed across age-adjusted quintiles of waist circumference. Greater degrees of central adiposity were associated with higher prevalence of elevated BP values and insulin resistance (P value < .001, X2 for linear trend). Conclusions: In middle-aged men, a central distribution of body fat is associated with increased BP, independently of body mass index and insulin resistance, thus suggesting a key role of central adiposity in the full expression of the ""metabolic syndrome."" © 2002 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd."

Research Methods and Procedures: Sixty-five women participated in the study (32 African American and 33 white). The mean age of subjects was 34 ± 6 years (range, 22 to 47 years). Eligible subjects were women who had body mass indices <25 kg/m2 at baseline and who had completed evaluations at baseline and at follow-up year 1, without intervention. A subset of subjects was reevaluated annually for up to 4 years. Body composition was assessed by DXA, and VAT was determined from a single computed tomography scan. A linear mixed model was used to examine changes in VAT over time, with total body fat as a covariate Results: Total fat mass was not significantly different between races at baseline and increased significantly in both groups over time (p < 0.001). Time-related increases in total body fat were greater in African-American women (p < 0.01). VAT was significantly higher in white women at baseline (p < 0.01) and increased significantly over time in both races (p < 0.01), but remained higher in white women (p < 0.001 ). Increases in VAT, relative to total body fat, were greater than the increases in total body fat over time, independent of age and race (p < 0.001). Discussion: Gaining total body-fat mass results in a higher increase in VAT, relative to total body fat, regardless of race and age, although African-American women maintain a lower VAT levels across time."

Methods: Elbow flexors were vertically stretched under four different velocities (40, 80, 120, and 160°/s) through a 75° range of motion in 12 patients with hemiparesis, 16 with parkinsonism, and 12 normal controls. From reactive torque measurement, a linear second order model was adopted to dissociate velocity dependent viscous and velocity independent elastic components. The averaged speed dependent reflex torque (ASRT) - defined as the deviation of measured torque from baseline torque - was used to quantify the viscous component of hypertonia. Velocity sensitivity of ASRT (VASRT) and segmented ASRT (SASRT), derived from the slope of the regression line among ASRT velocity plots and from segmentations of reactive torque, respectively, were used to differentiate the increased muscle tone of spasticity and rigidity. Results: ASRT and VASRT were significantly higher in both spasticity and rigidity than in normal controls. SASRT analysis showed three different position related patterns among spasticity, rigidity, and normal groups: spasticity showed progressively increasing muscle tension relative to position; rigidity showed increased (relative to the norm) but constant muscle tone over the entire stretch range; the normal control group showed a consistently low reactive torque over the entire range. Conclusions: Velocity dependence analysis indicates that rigidity and spasticity have approximately equal velocity dependent properties. For differentiating these two types of hypertonia, position dependent properties my be employed."

All cows had three successive lactations. Energy balance for days 1 to 305 of each of the three lactations was calculated both from daily measures of feed intake and milk output and from weekly measures of live weight and condition score. Cows returned to positive energy balance at days 72, 75, and 95 in lactations 1, 2, and 3, respectively, based on energy balance calculated from feed intake and milk output records (EB1), and at days 77, 83, and 73 based on energy balance calculated from body energy state changes (EB2). Correlations between energy balance at the same time in successive lactations ranged from 0.01 to 0.66 depending on the method of calculation and the stage of lactation. Energy balance over three lactations was modelled using sinusoidal functions which were associated with individual cows and allowed to vary between cows. The parameters of these curves are potentially useful since they have a biological interpretation. The phase relates to the period from calving to return to positive energy balance, and the amplitude relates to the degree of body energy loss (and recovery). The sinusoidal functions fitted to the curve removed a significant proportion of the variation, but accounted for only 45% and 40% of the variation in EB1 and EB2, respectively. The relationship between energy balance in the first three lactations is likely to be more complex than a simple linear function, but the profile of energy balance over the first three lactations may be a useful selection criteria in a multi-trait index. Energy balance profile over lactations one to three can be modelled with moderate accuracy using sinusoidal functions, and this warrants further research."

This paper investigates whether such political differences at Federal and State levels have influenced suicide rates in the state of New South Wales (NSW) for the period 1901-1998. Design: Federal government type, NSW State government type, and combinations of both Federal and NSW State government type were examined. Poisson regression models were stratified by sex and controlled for the effects of age, annual change in gross domestic product, sedative availability, drought, and both world wars. Results: When both Federal and NSW State governments were conservative the relative risk of suicide for NSW men was 1.17 (p<0.001) and for women 1.40 (p<0.001) compared with both governments being Labor (1.00). A statistically significant linear trend (p<0.001) in suicide risk was evident across the continuum of Federal/State government combinations, from both Labor (lowest), to mixed (intermediate), to both conservative (highest). Conclusion: Significantly higher suicide risk was associated with conservative government tenures compared with social democratic incumbents. Results are discussed in terms of the differences underpinning conservative and social democratic government programme ideology, and their relevance to Durkheim's theories of suicide, social regulation, and integration."

It is speculated, but unconfirmed, that the usual electrocardiographic manifestations of hyperkalaemia are less frequent and less pronounced in persons with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) than in those with normal renal function. We studied 74 consecutively selected stable haemodialysis patients to determine the prevalence of electrocardiographic changes of hyperkalaemia in stable persons with ESRD receiving haemodialysis. Methods. Pre-dialysis serum potassium concentration and other electrolytes were measured and simultaneous 12-lead electrocardiogram obtained. Results. The 74 study subjects (45 men, 29 women) comprised 63 blacks (85%), four Hispanics (6%), four whites (6%), and three Asians (4%) of mean ± standard deviation age 55.5 ± 14.7 years. Mean pre-dialysis potassium concentration was 4.9 ± 0.71 mEq/1 (range 3.3-6.7). No study subject evinced arrhythmia or any of the typical electrocardiographic changes associated with hyperkalaemia. There was no significant difference in T wave amplitude (F statistic = 2.1; P = 0.11) or T wave to R wave ratio (F statistic = 2; P = 0.12) between quartiles of serum potassium concentration. Also, T wave amplitude was equivalent in patients with serum potassium concentration > 5.5 mEq/1 (7.1 ± 4.1 mm) or ≤ 5.5 mEq/1 (5.2 ± 3.5 mm) (P = 0.13). Linear regression analysis showed that the total serum calcium concentration had an inverse relation with T wave amplitude (P = 0.03) after adjustment for other factors (a high total serum calcium concentration was associated with a low T wave amplitude). Conclusion. Haemodialysis patients with hyperkalaemia may not exhibit the usual electrocardiographic sequella of hyperkalaemia, possibly due in part to fluctuations in serum calcium concentration. Thus, the absence of electrocardiographic changes in hyperkalaemic haemodialysis patients should be inter reted with caution."

The extent of lung function loss tended to be higher among those who, at baseline, reported greater BMI values. Males experienced larger losses than females (20 and 16 mL FEV1 median reduction for a BMI unit increase in males and females, respectively).

Half of the dialysis population suffers from hyperphosphataemia, which is now recognized as a major factor of haemodialysis (HD) morbidity and mortality. Current control is focussed on reducing dietary phosphate intake and diminishing absorption using phosphate binders, whereas control and quantification of phosphate removal by HD is undervalued. The aim of this prospective study was to develop a simple, bedside formula to estimate dialytic phosphate removal in stable HD patients. Methods. This was a prospective, randomized trial. Phosphate and urea elimination were assessed in a representative group of patients at two dialysis centres using randomly different dialysers (1.3-2.4 m2). Quantification was performed by partial dialysate collection, concentration measurements in blood and effluent dialysate spot samples, and Kt/Vurea during standard high-flux HD. Multiple linear regression analyses were used in 77% of all data sets to generate an equation to predict phosphate removal. The formula was validated in the remaining 23% of data sets, in the same group of patients using a large capillary filter, and in diabetic patients treated with a small dialyser at different blood flows (200, 250, and 300 ml/min). Results. A formula allowing quantification of phosphate removal within one HD session was developed in 18 of 74 patients during 41 treatments (137 out of 177 data sets) and was determined as: MPO4pred = 0.1t - 17 + 50cds60 + 11cb60, where t is treatment time in min, cds60 and cb60 are phosphate concentrations in dialysate and plasma measured 60 min into HD in mmol/l, and MPO4pred is estimated phosphate removed in mmol. The precision was remarkable (r2 = 0.92-0.94). The comparison of phosphate and Kt/Vurea showed a significant association (r2=0.28), albeit with remarkable scatter. Conclusions. We present the first approach to quantify phosphate removal during high-flux HD by a bedside formula. Only 28% of the variation in phosphate removal was explained by Kt/Vurea. It appears that other factors not adequately accounted for by Kt/Vurea affect phosphate removal. Therefore, we propose an individual control and quantification of phosphate removal in HD."

The subjects were randomly selected from the 7th, 8th and 9th grades in two junior high schools in Taiwan. Physical activity was estimated as total daily energy expenditure and energy expenditure in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity from 24-hour activity records for three days, two week days and one weekend day. Health-related fitness was assessed as the one-mile run (cardiorespiratory endurance), timed sit-ups (abdominal strength and endurance), sit-and-reach (lower back flexibility), and subcutaneous fatness (sum of the triceps, subscapular, suprailiac, and medial calf skinfolds). Physical activity is significantly and positively correlated with one-mile run performance and the sit-and-reach, but not with sit-ups and subcutaneous fatness. Overall, the strength of the relationships between estimated energy expenditure and specific fitness items in the total sample vary from low to moderate, with only 1% to 12% of the variance in fitness variables being explained by estimated energy expenditure. Comparisons of active versus inactive, and fit versus unfit adolescents provide additional insights.

The relative contributions of particular characteristics affecting exposure levels were assessed as in a multiple regression model, while controlling for the correlation between repeated measurements. While one-way ANOVA allows one only to estimate unconditioned variance components, a mixed model enables estimation of between- and within-worker variance components of exposure levels while accounting for the fixed effects of work characteristics. Consequently, we can identify the work characteristics affecting each variance component. Mixed models were applied to the data sets with repeated measurements and auxiliary information on work characteristics. The between-worker variance components were reduced by 35, 66 and 80%, respectively, in the three data sets when work characteristics were taken into account. The within-worker (day-to-day) variability was reduced only in the pig farmer data set, by 25%, when accounting for work activities. In addition, coefficients of work characteristics from the mixed model were compared with coefficients resulting from originally published multiple linear regression models. In the rubber manufacturing data, the coefficients of the mixed model showed similar relative importance, but were generally smaller than the coefficients from regression models. However, in the pig farm data, only the coefficients of work activities were somewhat reduced. The mixed model is a helpful tool for estimating factors affecting exposure and suitable variance components. Identifying the factors in the working environment that affect the between-worker variability facilitates a posteriori grouping of workers into more uniformly exposed groups. Identifying the factors that affect the within-worker variance is helpful for hazard control and in designing efficient sampling schemes with reference to time schedule."

Comparisons of skill are made among forecasts generated using five different linear and nonlinear statistical methodologies, namely, linear regression, discriminant analysis, logistic regression, neural networks, and a classifier system. The predictors for the different statistical models were selected from a large pool of analyzed and predicted variables generated by the Nested Grid Model (NGM) during the four cool seasons (December-March) from 1992/93 to 1995/96. Because linear regression is the current method used by the National Weather Service, it is chosen as the benchmark by which the other methodologies are compared. The results indicate that logistic regression performs best among all methodologies. Most notable is that it performs significantly better at the 99% confidence limits than linear regression, attaining Brier skill scores of 0.413, 0.480, and 0.478 versus 0.378, 0.440, and 0.457 for linear regression, at thresholds of 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10 in., respectively. Attributes diagrams reveal that linear regression gives a greater number of forecast probabilities closer to climatology than does logistic regression at all three thresholds. Moreover, these forecasts are more biased toward lower-than-observed probabilities and are further from the ""perfect reliability"" line in almost all probability categories than are the forecasts made by logistic regression. For the other methodologies, the classifier system also showed significantly greater skill than did linear regression, and discriminant analysis and neural networks gave mixed results."

Health service utilisation was measured by annual consultation, monthly consultation and hospitalisation rates. HRQOL was measured by the SF-36. Multivariate regressions were used to test the dependence of service utilisation rates on sociodemographic factors, chronic morbidity and the SF-36 scores. Structured multiphase regression analyses were used to determine the magnitude of the effect of the SF-36 scores, in addition to those of sociodemographic and chronic morbidity factors, on service utilisation. Five of eight SF-36 scores were independent determinants of consultation rates. They doubled and tripled the percentages of variance explained for annual and monthly consultation rates, respectively.

To evaluate the quality of life in glaucomatous patients using two different questionnaires: the medical outcomes study 36-item short-form health survey (MOS SF-36) and Viswanathan et al's questionnaire and to compare these two questionnaires. Methods. Seventy-seven patients with glaucoma were consecutively selected. Two force-choice questionnaires were administered to each patient. Viswanathan et al's questionnaire was related to visual disability and the second was related to the quality of life from the MOS 36-item short-form health survey. Both questionnaires were evaluated among all the considered patients and the results were compared. Then the questionnaire which did the best evaluation was used to test the quality of life in three different subgroups based on the mean deviation of the worse eye. Mann-Whitney non parametric test and Spearman's r coefficient were used and a P value less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. A linear regression model was used. Results. In the entire group (n = 77) the Mean Deviation (MD) was -6.5 ± 6.8 dB (mean ± standard deviation) and Corrected Pattern Standard Deviation (CPSD) was 4.7 ± 4.1 dB. The score of the Viswanathan et al's questionnaire was 8.3 ± 2.4, while MOS SF-36 score ranged from 60.5% to 100% (mean score %).

Because this outcome parameter appeared to be virtually independent of confounders, including cultural differences, a joint analysis of benchmark doses was carried out. Comparable cohort members included 382 Faroese and 113 Madeiran children without middle ear infection or neurological disease at age seven years. Maternal hair-mercury concentrations at parturition in the Faroese cohort ranged from 0.6 to 39.1 μg/g (geometric average, 4.49 μg/g). In Madeira, mothers who had not changed their diet since pregnancy had current hair-mercury concentrations ranging from 1.1 to 54.4 μg/g (geometric average 10.14 μg/g). The mercury-associated delay in peak III latencies at two frequencies (20 and 40 Hz) showed similar regression equations in the two groups of children, and benchmark dose calculations were therefore carried out for the two groups separately and jointly. For a doubling of a 5% prevalence of abnormal results of the peak III latencies at 40 Hz in a linear dose-response model, the benchmark dose for the maternal hair-mercury concentration was 8.79 μg/g for the Faroese children; 8.04 μg/g for the Madeiran children; and 9.46 μg/g for both groups. Results were similar for the 20 Hz condition. Benchmark dose results were substantially lower using a logarithmic or square root curve function, although the difference in fit between the curves was far from statistically significant. The benchmark results using evoked potential latencies are in close agreement with results based on neuropsychological test performance."

Method: To demonstrate trends in outcome, severity adjusted odds of death per year of admission to hospital were calculated for all hospitals (n=99) and 20 hospitals who had participated since 1989 (adjustments are for Injury Severity Score, age, and Revised Trauma Score). The grade of doctor initially seeing the injured patient in accident and emergency and median prehospital times per year of admission were calculated to demonstrate trends in the process of care. Trend analyses were carried out using simple linear regression (odds ratio versus year). Results: The analysis shows a significant reduction in the severity adjusted odds of death of 3% per year over the 1989-2000 time period (p=0.001). During the period 1989-1994 the odds of death declined most steeply (on average 6% per year p=0.004). Between 1994 to 2000 no significant change occurred (p=0.35). This pattern was mirrored by the 20 permanent members where the odds of death also declined more steeply over the 1989-1994 period. The percentage of severely injured patients (ISS > 15) seen by a consultant increased from 29 to 40 from 1989-1994 but has remained static subsequently. Median prehospital times for severely injured patients have not changed significantly since 1994 (51 to 45 minutes). Conclusion: Most of the case fatality reduction for trauma patients reaching hospital over the 1989-2000 time period occurred before 1995 when there was most marked change in the initial care of severely injured patients."

Classical autoregressive moving average (ARMA) methods can adequately address the problem of linear time invariant, short-memory errors but may be inefficient and/or insufficient to secure type 1 error control in the context of fractal or scale invariant noise with a more slowly decaying autocorrelation function. Here we introduce a novel method, called wavelet-generalized least squares (WLS), which is (to a good approximation) the best linear unbiased (BLU) estimator of regression model parameters in the context of long-memory errors. The method also provides maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of the Hurst exponent (which can be readily translated to the fractal dimension or spectral exponent) characterizing the correlational structure of the errors, and the error variance. The algorithm exploits the whitening or Karhunen-Loéve-type property of the discrete wavelet transform to diagonalize the covariance matrix of the errors generated by an iterative fitting procedure after both data and design matrix have been transformed to the wavelet domain. Properties of this estimator, including its Cramèr-Rao bounds, are derived theoretically and compared to its empirical performance on a range of simulated data. Compared to ordinary least squares and ARMA-based estimators, WLS is shown to be more efficient and to give excellent type 1 error control. The method is also applied to some real (neurophysiological) data acquired by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the human brain. We conclude that wavelet-generalized least squares may be a generally useful estimator of regression models in data complicated by long-memory or fractal noise. © 2002 Elsevier Science."

In order to elucidate whether a causal relationship between these phenomena exists, we investigated the influence of testosterone or human chorionic gonadotrophin substitution on body mass index (BMI), total fat mass and serum leptin in testosterone-treated and untreated hypogonadal patients in comparison with ageing eugonadal men. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, the inter-relationships of body weight, total fat mass, serum sex hormones and leptin were analysed in untreated hypogonadal men (n = 24; age 19-65 years), treated hypogonadal men (n = 61; age 20-67 years) and healthy eugonadal men (n = 60; age 24-78 years). Total fat mass was assessed by bioimpedance measurement. Univariate and multiple linear regression analysis was used to detect possible differences. Results: In eugonadal men, serum testosterone levels decreased with advancing age (correlation coefficents: r = -0.71; P < 0.0001), while BMI (r = 0.39; P = 0.002), total fat content (r = 0.51; P < 0.0001) and leptin (r = 0.48; P < 0.0001) increased significantly. In untreated hypogonadal patients, an increase in BMI (r = 0.50; P = 0.013) and total fat mass (r = 0.41; P = 0.044) was also observed with advancing age. However, in substituted hypogonadal patients, no age-dependent change in BMI (r = 0.067; P = 0.606), body fat content (r = -0.083; P = 0.522), serum testosterone (r = -0, 071; P = 0.59) or serum leptin (r = -0.23; P = 0.176) was found. Conclusion: Since testosterone-substituted older hypogonadal men show BMI and fat mass similar to those of younger eugonadal men and since non-treated hypogonadal men are similar to normal ageing men, testosterone appears to be an important factor contributing to these changes. Thus ageing men should benefit from testosterone substitution as far as body composition is concerned."

The DCM phenotype exhibits changes in the expression of genes that regulate contractile function and pathologic hypertrophy. However, it is unclear if any of these alterations in gene expression are disease producing or modifying. Materials and Methods: One approach to providing evidence for cause-effect of a disease-influencing gene is to quantitatively compare changes in phenotype to changes in gene expression by employing serial measurements in a longitudinal experimental design. We investigated the quantitative relationships between changes in gene expression and phenotype n 47 patients with idiopathic DCM. In endomyocardial biopsies at baseline and 6 months later, we measured mRNA expression of genes regulating contractile function (β-adrenergic receptors, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase, and α- and β-myosin heavy chain isoforms) or associated with pathologic hypertrophy (β-myosin heavy chain and atrial natriuretic peptide), plus β-adrenergic receptor protein expression. Left ventricular phenotype was assessed by radionuclide ejection fraction. Results: Improvement in DCM phenotype was directly related to a coordinate increase in α- and a decrease in β-myosin heavy chain mRNA expression. In contrast, modification of phenotype was unrelated to changes in the expression of β1- or β2-adrenergic receptor mRNA or protein, or to the mRNA expression of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase and atrial natriuretic peptide. Conclusion: We conclude that in human DCM, phenotypic modification is selectively associated with myosin heavy chain isoform changes. These data support the hypothesis that myosin heavy chain isoform changes contribute to disease progression in human DCM."

The authors hypothesized that the noise dependence can be reduced by a linear regression model that minimizes the sum of squared perpendicular rather than vertical (y) distances between the data points and fitted straight line. To test the new method, 15 levels of simulated noise (repeated 2,000 times) were added to synthetic tissue activity curves, calculated from two different sets of kinetic parameters. Contrary to the traditional method, there was no (P > 0.05) or dramatically decreased noise dependence with the perpendicular model. Real dynamic 11C (+) McN5652 serotonin transporter binding data were processed either by applying Logan analysis to average counts of large areas or by averaging the Logan slopes of individual-voxel data. There were no significant differences between the parameters when the perpendicular regression method was used with both approaches. The presented experiments show that the DVt calculated from the Logan plot is much less noise dependent if the linear regression model accounts for errors in both the x and y variables, allowing fast creation of unbiased parametric images from dynamic positron-emission tomography studies."

Bone lead was measured at the tibia and patella with K x-ray fluorescence. Blood lead was analyzed by graphite furnace atomic absorption. Participants were aged 46-74 years and had mean lead levels of 3 (standard deviation, 2) μg/dl (blood), 13 (standard deviation, 9) μg/g (tibia), and 17 (standard deviation, 11) μg/g (patella). In multivariate linear regression models, use of postmenopausal estrogen (inverse) and alcohol intake (positive) were significantly associated with blood lead levels. Both bone lead measures were significantly and positively associated with blood lead but only among postmenopausal women not using estrogen; for example, an increase from the first to the fifth quintile of tibia lead level (19 μg/g) was associated with a 1.7-μg/dl increase in blood lead (p = 0.0001) in this group. Older age and lower parity were associated with higher tibia lead; only age was associated with patella lead. The observed interaction of bone lead with estrogen status in determining blood lead supports the hypothesis that increased bone resorption, as occurs postmenopausally because of decreased estrogen production, results in heightened release of bone lead stores into blood."

The epidemiology, pathogenesis and prognosis of severe ischemic early liver injury (SIELI) after cardiac surgery are poorly understood. Accordingly, we studied patients whose alanine transaminase (ALT) concentration acutely increased above 500 IU/1 in the immediate postoperative period and compared these patients to two control groups matched for preoperative and immediate postoperative characteristics. Methods. We used a prospective database of 1,800 consecutive cardiac surgical cases to identify the study groups. Group I was made up of 20 patients with ALT levels above 500 IU/L in the acute postoperative stage (SIELI). Preoperative liver tests were normal in all these patients. Group II was obtained by identifying 20 control cases whose age, type of surgery, NYHA classification, and Parsonnet score matched Group I (preoperative controls). Group III was obtained by identifying 20 patients who developed postoperative acute renal failure and shock (ARF/shock; postoperative controls) but no enzyme evidence of hepatic injury. Results. Acute renal failure, a low cardiac index (CI) state, and mortality were more common in SIELI and ARF/Shock patients compared with preoperative controls (all p values less than 0.01). Peak postoperative pulmonary artery occlusion (PAOP) and central venous (CVP) pressures were also higher in SIELI and ARF/Shock patients than controls (all p values less than 0.02). A higher dose of norepinephrine and milrinone were required to maintain blood pressure and cardiac output in SIELI and ARF/shock patients than preoperative controls (all p values less than 0.005). SIELI patients, however, differed from ARF/Shock patients in that they had a higher preoperative NYHA class and a greater incidence of hypertension and diabetes. Stepwise linear regression analysis identified a postoperative low CI and the presence of diabetes as the only predictors of peak ALT value (p less than 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified female gender as being associated with a higher likelihood of SIELI (odds ratio: 6.13; 95% CI 1.08 to 34.82) Conclusions. SIELI after cardiac surgery carries a high mortality and is strongly associated with a low cardiac output and increased filling pressures, suggesting that liver ischemia induced by a combination of decreased perfusion and congestion is fundamental to its pathogenesis. A history of cardiac failure, diabetes, hypertension, and female gender may represent risk factors for its development and severity in the setting of a postoperative low cardiac output state. © 2002 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons."

The thrombelastograph® is commonly used to assess point-of-care whole blood coagulation. Little is known about the dose-response relationships of haemodilution, and it is reasonable to assume that a linear association exists. This may not be the case with altered electrolyte compositions of the fluids used for haemodilution. We have therefore conducted an in vitro study of haemodilution of human whole blood using lactated Ringer's solution and two high molecular weight hetastarches, one in a balanced salt solution, the other in a 0.9% saline solution. The thrombelastograph®, commonly used for the assessment of the coagulation effects of synthetic colloids, was used as the coagulation assessment device. Serial haemodilution with hetastarch in a balanced salt solution demonstrated a biphasic response (of r-times and k-times, as well as alpha angles), with haemodilution in the 20-40% range causing enhanced coagulation, and higher degrees of dilution causing a decrease in overall coagulation performance. A similar picture was observed with lactated Ringer's solution, but only significantly so in alpha angles. Hetastarch in saline did not display this initial increased coagulability at mild to moderate dilutions. This biphasic response of lactated Ringer's solution and hetastarch in a balanced salt solution reflects the complex interaction of fluids and the coagulation system, and that these effects cannot be attributed to simple haemodilution. On the other hand, there was a linear decrease in maximum amplitude with haemodilution. Maximum amplitude was particularly affected by both starches, which is an expected finding in view of the known interaction between the hydroxyethyl starches and von Willebrand's factor."

A diverse range of unprocessed, industrial fed-batch fermentation broths containing the fungus Gibberella fujikuroi producing the natural product gibberellic acid, were analyzed directly without a priori chromatographic separation. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) were applied to all of the information-rich spectra obtained by each of the methods to obtain quantitative information on the gibberellic acid titer. These estimates were of good precision, and the typical root-mean-square error for predictions of concentrations in an independent test set was <10% over a very wide titer range from 0 to 4925 ppm. However, although PLSR and ANNs are very powerful techniques they are often described as ""black box"" methods because the information they use to construct the calibration model is largely inaccessible. Therefore, a variety of novel evolutionary computation-based methods, including genetic algorithms and genetic programming, were used to produce models that allowed the determination of those input variables that contributed most to the models formed, and to observe that these models were predominantly based on the concentration of gibberellic acid itself. This is the first time that these three modern analytical spectroscopies, in combination with advanced chemometric data analysis, have been compared for their ability to analyze a real commercial bioprocess. The results demonstrate unequivocally that all methods provide very rapid and accurate estimates of the progress of industrial fermentations, and indicate that, of the three methods studied, Raman spectroscopy is the ideal bioprocess monitoring method because it can be adapted for on-line analysis. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

A stepwise regression is used to test whether the components are significant. Special emphasis is given to extreme events which we distinguish from extreme values. While extreme values may likely occur by chance, it is very unlikely that extreme events would be in accordance with the features of the time series. On one hand, extreme events alter the estimates (and test results) of trends and other components. On the other hand, such components have to be known to recognize extreme events. To deal with this problem, an iterative procedure is introduced that converges fast to robust estimates of all the components. Applying this procedure to the last 100 years of European temperatures reveals that the phase of the annual cycle is shifted backward within the year in western Europe but foreward in eastern Europe. In the latter region, the amplitude of the annual cycle has also increased significantly. Most of the trend components found in the time series are positive and linear. Nearly all detected extreme events are cold events which occurred in winter. Their number has significantly grown. Significant harmonic components with a period of 92.3 months (about 7.7 years) are found mainly in northern and western Europe."

Patients and methods: The study involved 45 consecutive patients with Crohn's disease and suspected internal fistulae detected by grey scale US. The fistulae were subsequently evaluated using power Doppler US to reveal any areas of increased vascularity, and the results were compared with radiographic, endoscopic, or intraoperative findings. Whenever feasible, we also performed spectral analysis of blood flow revealed by power Doppler US, calculated its resistance index (RI), and analysed its characteristics, reproducibility, and relationship with biochemical and clinical variables (Crohn's disease activity index, disease duration, location, and abdominal complications). Results: Power Doppler US revealed vascularity in all of the internal fistulae that where subsequently confirmed by diagnostic procedures. In the case of intra-abdominal abscesses in the vicinity of the fistula, vascular signals were detected mostly around and not within the lesions. The intensity and distribution of the signals differed within the fistulae tracks and had only slight day to day reproducibility; furthermore, there was no significant correlation with clinical or biochemical variables. Spectral analyses of blood flow within the fistulae revealed arterial flow in 96.7% of patients (median RI 0.715). RI was a more reproducible parameter and significantly correlated with clinical (r= 0.54) and biochemical activity (r= 0.56) of CD. It was also higher in fistulae complicated by abscesses. Conclusion: Power Doppler US can reveal the presence of vasculature within the wall of internal fistulae and therefore enhance grey scale US performance.

Energy expenditure in household activities was also recorded. Multivariate linear regression analyses were used to adjust for the effect of physical activity on lipid peroxides and SOD and GSH-Px for confounding variables. Results: The amount of leisure time physical activity was associated with high activity levels of SOD (P = 0.022) and GSH-Px (P = 0.002). Similar results were obtained when physical activity in household activities was added to total leisure physical activity. Physical activity of low intensity was associated with high SOD activity levels (P = 0.002) and that of high intensity with high GSH-Px activity levels (P = 0.001).

Remotely sensed observations by satellite sensors are the only feasible means of obtaining regional- and continental-scale measurements of climate at regular intervals for real-time epidemiological applications, such as disease early warning systems. The potential of Pathfinder AVHRR Land (PAL) data to provide surrogate variables for near-surface air temperature (Ta) and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) over Africa and Europe was assessed in this context. For the years 1988-1990 and 1992, correlations were examined between meteorological ground measurements (monthly mean Ta and VPDgrd) and variables derived from advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) data [land surface temperature (LST) and VPDsat]. The AVHRR indices were derived from both daily and composite PAL data so that their relative performance could be determined. Furthermore, the ground observations were divided into African and European subsets, so that the relative performance of the satellite data at tropical/subtropical and temperate latitudes could be assessed. Significant correlations were shown between Ta and LST in all months. Temporal variability existed in the strength of correlations throughout any 12-month period, with the pattern of variability consistent between years. The adjusted r2 values increased when elevation and the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) were included, in addition to LST, as predictor variables of Ta. Attempts to derive monthly estimates of atmospheric moisture availability resulted in an overestimation of VPDsat compared to ground observations, VPDgrd. The use of daily PAL data to derive monthly mean climatic indices was shown to be more accurate than those obtained using monthly maximum values from 10-day composite data. A subset of the 1992 data was then used to build linear regression models for the direct retrieval of monthly mean Ta from PAL data. The accuracy of retrieved estimates was greatest when NDVI was included with LST as predictor variables, with root mean square errors (RMSEs) varying from 1.83°C to 3.18°C with a mean of 2.38°C over the 12-month period. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

By using identical sets of predictors and predictands, the methods are compared in terms of their performance over an independent retroactive forecast period, which includes the 1980s and 1990s. The models outperform persistence and damped persistence as reference forecast strategies at some times of the year. The models have greatest skill in predicting El Niño, although La Niña is predicted with greater skill at longer lead times and with greater reliability. The forecasts for the ENSO extremes are reasonably well calibrated, and so the forecast probabilities are reliable estimates of forecast uncertainty."

C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are increased in 30 to 50% of dialysis patients and predict cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It is usually considered that raised CRP levels reflect underlying atherosclerosis. However, many patients may have clinically apparent cardiovascular disease without raised CRP levels. This study was designed to assess both the risk factors for high CRP levels and the usefulness of the test as a marker of clinically apparent coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and the presence of ongoing infections/inflammatory disorders (INF-INFL) in peritoneal dialysis patients. Methods. A chart review of 190 prevalent peritoneal dialysis patients was performed. CRP, albumin, ferritin, erythropoietin (EPO) dose and resistance, Kt/V, and residual renal function values were obtained and a history or presence of cardiovascular disease (CAD, PVD) and presence of INF-INFL recorded. Data were analyzed by Chi-square, Spearman correlation and logistic regression. Results. A total of 31% of patients had a raised CRP. INF-INFL was highly predictive of raised CRP levels (OR 16.97; 95% CI 5.41 to 53.14, P = 0.000), whereas CAD and PVD either singly or in combination had no such association. The sensitivity/specificity for CRP as a test for INF-INFL was 83/77%. For CAD and PVD, the sensitivities were less than 40% and specificities 70%. Increased CRP values were more common in females but not in diabetics. Weak linear correlations existed between CRP levels and albumin, ferritin and residual renal function (r = -0.212, 0.228 and -0.163 respectively, P < 0.02). By regression analysis, INF-INFL predicted high CRP levels, but CAD and PVD did not. The majority of patients (57%) with high CRP had no identifiable cause; 40% of these patients had subsequent or previous normal CRP values. High transport status predicted high CRP levels (OR 7.28; 95% CI 1.417 to 37.36, P = 0.006). Conclusions. The majority of elevated CRP levels in peritoneal dialysis patients occur without an obvious cause. Clinically apparent cardiovascular disease does not predict high CRP levels. CRP levels vary over time in the same patient, from normal to high or vice versa, for no obvious reason. Sources of inflammation other than CAD, PVD and clinically obvious INF-INFL in peritoneal dialysis patients remain to be identified."

A validated physical activity questionnaire measured, for each participant, the total energy expenditure and its percentage used in high-intensity activities (%high-intensity activity), eg, brisk walking and sports. The effects of the apoE×%high-intensity activity interaction on the lipid profile were investigated by using multiple linear regression models. Among men, increased %high-intensity activity had greater protective effects in the apoE4 group regarding (1) high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (P<0.001), compared with either the apoE2 (interaction P=0.05) or apoE3 (interaction P<0.03) groups, and (2) triglycerides (P<0.03), compared with the apoE3 group (interaction P=0.07). A 10% increase of %high-intensity activity by an apoE4 man would correspond with a 0.07-mmol/L increase in HDL cholesterol and a -0.15-mmol/L decrease in triglycerides. Among women, only the protective effects of physical activity on HDL cholesterol in the apoE4 group versus the apoE2 group was statistically significant. Spending a larger fraction of the total energy expenditure in high-intensity activities may counteract the atherogenic effects of the ε4 allele on the lipid profile."

The objective of this study was to investigate the association between those behavioral cardiovascular risk factors and asymptomatic atherosclerosis of the carotid arteries in a population of former East Germany. Methods - The Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) is a cross-sectional survey in northeast Germany. In 1632 individuals aged 45 to 70 years, high-resolution B-mode ultrasound was used to assess the mean intima-media thickness of the right and left common carotid arteries. Carotid plaques and stenosis were recorded. Physical activity, dietary patterns, and cardiovascular risk factors were assessed in interviews with the use of standardized scales. Physically active participants with optimal dietary patterns were classified in the optimal lifestyle group, and those inactive with unfavorable diet were classified in the unfavorable group. Results - After adjustment for sex and age, significant decreasing trends were found for both intima-media thickness and severe asymptomatic atherosclerosis from unfavorable to optimal lifestyle patterns in never smokers but not in smokers. Regression analysis revealed an increased risk of severe asymptomatic atherosclerosis in subjects with an unfavorable lifestyle pattern compared with those with an optimal pattern (odds ratio 2.68; 95% CI, 1.13 to 6.37), following a significant linear trend. Conclusions - Physical activity and optimal diet are associated with reduced risk of early atherosclerosis in subjects who never smoked, while no benefit of an otherwise optimal lifestyle is observed in smokers."

Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed in 741 third-trimester high-risk pregnancies. The uterine artery score was constructed assigning one point to each abnormal parameter - high pulsatility index and presence of notch - thus ranging from 0 (normal findings in both uterine arteries) to 4 (notch and high pulsatility index in both uterine arteries). In a subgroup with lateral placenta (n = 359), two definitions of abnormal pulsatility index were compared. In the uniform uterine artery score, a pulsatility index > 1.20 in both uterine arteries was considered abnormal, disregarding the placental location; in the subgroup with lateral placenta, the high pulsatility index was defined as > 1.00 on the placental side and > 1.40 on the non-placental side. Results: Receiver-operating characteristic curves did not reveal any difference in the diagnostic capacity between the group with a uniform uterine artery score and the subgroup with lateral placenta (P = 0.54). In the total material, the odds ratios and linear regression analysis showed an increased risk for an adverse perinatal outcome with increasing uterine artery score (P < 0.01). At a uterine artery score > 2, there was a significantly increased risk for operative delivery for fetal distress, neonatal intensive care unit admission, 5-min Apgar score < 7, preterm delivery and delivery of a small-for-gestational age fetus. Conclusion: In high-risk third-trimester pregnancies, Doppler velocity waveforms of the uterine arteries can be evaluated using the uterine artery score disregarding the placental location.

Results: Using linear models, fat-free mass, fat mass, visceral fat, and age were significantly related to RMR, but the usual level of physical activity was not. After adjustment for these variables, mean RMR was significantly higher in whites (1665.07 ± 10.78 kcal/d) than in African Americans (1585.05 ± 11.02 kcal/d) by 80 ± 16 kcal/d (p < 0.0001).

Discussion: RMR is ∼5% higher in white than in African-American participants in CARDIA. The difference was the same for men and women and for lean and obese individuals. The prevalence of obesity is not higher in African-American men than in white men. Because of these reasons, we believe that RMR differences are unlikely to be a primary explanation for why African-American women are more prone to obesity than white women."

Results: The index joint (that is, the most symptomatic joint) was the knee in 118 (94%) and the hip in eight (6%) patients. The median duration of pain and limitation of normal activities were three years and one year, respectively. The mean BP and PF scores of 57.7 and 56.2 points for the patients were substantially lower than the expected scores of 79.3 and 80.8 points for the general Singapore population. Multiple regression analysis showed that less pain was associated with a younger age, shorter duration of symptoms, more years of education, working, and Chinese ethnicity. Better physical function was associated with more years of education, less learned helplessness, less bodily pain, and less severe OA. Conclusions: Socioeconomic status and psychosocial factors, some of which are potentially modifiable, influence pain or physical function in Asian patients with OA in Singapore."

Values of Kp were collected from the literature. Only Kp values plausibly representing true steady state distribution were accepted, and data had to be available for muscle, fat, skin and at least five other organs. The apparent volume of distribution of a drug in an organ/tissue (Vapp) was calculated as Kp multiplied by the volume of the organ/tissue, and the Vdss as the sum of all available Vapp values. The percentage contribution of each Vapp to the Vdss was estimated. In addition, linear regressions were calculated between Kp values of all drugs in a specific organ/tissue and Kp in muscle or fat. Finally, the Vdss was re-calculated using (for basic drugs) the Kp in fat to calculate Vapp in fat and lungs and the Kp in muscle for the Vapp of all other organs/tissues. The two sets of estimates of Vdss were compared by linear regression. The same calculations were performed for acidic drugs, except that muscle Kp was used also for the lungs. Distribution to fat and muscle accounted for 84 % (61-91 %) (median and range) of the total estimated Vdss of the basic drugs (n = 17). The regressions between Kp in organs/tissues and muscle Kp were statistically significant except in the case of liver. For acidic drugs (n = 18), distribution to fat and muscle accounted for 65 % (42-92 %) of Vdss, and the regressions of Kp were significant for all organs/tissues except kidney and bone. For both types of drugs, correlations between organ/tissue Kp values and Kp in fat were generally worse. There were excellent linear correlations between Vdss calculated by means of only two Kp values and the originally calculated Vss (r2 ≥ 0.99 for both basic and acidic drugs; slopes were not significantly different from unity). Thus, initial estimation of the Vdss of a new drug can normally be based on only two Kp values, those of muscle and fat. The muscle Kp can be used to represent all lean tissues, including the residual ""carcass"", with the exception that fat Kp can be used for distribution of basic drugs to lungs."

Electromyographic (EMG) activities of external oblique and rectus abdominis muscles were recorded during incremental exercise to exhaustion and during 30 min of constant work rate exercise at an intensity of 85 % of the peak oxygen consumption rate VO2). High amplitude intramuscular EMG activities of both abdominal muscles could be evoked with postural manoeuvres in all subjects. During cycling, respiratory-related activity of the external obliques was evoked in four of seven subjects, whereas rectus abdominis activity was observed in six of the seven subjects. We measured only the activity that was confined exclusively to the expiratory phase of the respiratory cycle. Expiratory activity of both muscles increased with exercise intensity, although peak values averaged only 10-20 or 20-40% of the peak activity (obtained during maximal, voluntary expiratory efforts) for the external oblique and rectus abdominis muscles, respectively. To estimate how much of the recorded abdominal muscle activity was supporting leg movements during exercise, we compared the activity at the very end of incremental exercise to that recorded during the first five respiratory cycles after the abrupt cessation of exercise, when ventilation was still very high. Although external oblique activity was reduced after exercise stopped, clear expiratory activity remained. Rectus abdominis activity remained high after exercise cessation, showing a gradual decline that approximated the decline in ventilation. During constant work rate exercise, EMG activities increased to 40-50 and 5-10% of peak in rectus and external oblique muscles, respectively, and then plateaued for the remainder of the bout in spite of a continual upward drift in VO2 and pulmonary ventilation. Linear regression analysis showed that the rise in respiratory-related expiratory muscle activity during progressive intensity exercise was significantly correlated with ventilation, although weakly. In constant work rate exercise, expiratory EMG activities increased, but the changes were highly variable and did not change as a function of exercise time, even though ventilation drifted significantly with time. These experiments suggest that abdominal muscles play a role in regulating the ventilatory response to progressive intensity bicycle exercise, although some of the observed activity may support postural adjustments or limb movements. The contribution of abdominal muscles to ventilation during constant work rate exercise is variable, and expiratory activity does not 'drift' significantly with time."

The relative contribution of Methods: Data were obtained from one eye of each of 71 normal phakic subjects, age 9-80 years. The mfERG responses were recorded with the 7"" stimulus-refractor unit (EDI) and VERIS 4.3 using the following protocol: bipolar contact lens, 103 hexagons, consecutive stimulation with 200 and 700 cd·m-2, pupils ≥6 mm, amplification of 105, filter cut-offs at 10 and 300 Hz. Results: Age-correlated decreases in amplitude and response density and increases in P1 implicit time were found for both luminance levels. The mean response density (nV·deg-2) was higher for the 700 cd·m-2 stimulus, but the rate of change with age was not significantly different from that obtained with the 200 cd·m-2 stimulus. Implicit time was not significantly different for the two light levels, nor was the rate of change with age. The decrease in response density and the increase in implicit time with age were significant across all retinal regions, dividing the 50 deg stimulus into six concentric rings. Age-related change in response density was greatest for the central retina and decreased with increasing retinal eccentricity. Conclusion: Log mfERG response changes linearly as a function of age. Analyses of the effects of reduced ocular media transmission and increased stray light, along with ancillary data obtained from pseudophakes, imply that age-related changes in the mfERG are due to both optical and neural factors."

The methods may be used for a health outcome recorded on a continuous scale, as a Poisson count or as a binomial variable. Results and Conclusion: The confidence limits depend on the sampling variability of both the mean mortality rate and the slope of the regression line of mortality on the socioeconomic status scale variable. The best method for a continuous health outcome is based on Fieller's theorem but a good approximation is obtained by substituting the confidence limits for the slope of the regression line into the formula for the calculation of the index, or by using the variance of the logarithmic transform of the index. The last method is the most appropriate for the construction of significance tests comparing indices. The mortality rates may show statistically significant departure from linearity, while not suggesting that a linear relation is inappropriate, and the main decision is whether to base the confidence limits on the conventional standard error of the slope derived from the regression analysis or whether to use the standard deviation of the estimates of mortality rates."

In the present study, first, the prevalence of type III HLP among apoE2 homozygotes was estimated in a Dutch population sample of 8888 participants. Second, 68 normocholesterolemic and 162 hypercholesterolemic apoE2 homozygotes (type III HLP patients) were collected to investigate additional factors influencing type III HLP expression. In the Dutch population sample, apoE2 homozygosity occurred with a frequency of 0.6% (57 of 8888 individuals). Among the 57 E2/2 subjects, 10 type III HLP patients were identified (prevalence 18%). Comparison of normocholesterolemic E2/2 subjects and type III HLP patients showed that the latter had a significantly increased body mass index (25.6±4.0 versus 26.9±3.8 kg/m2, respectively; P=0.03) and prevalence of hyperinsulinemia (26% versus 63%, respectively; P<0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that most of the variability in type III HLP expression can be explained by fasting insulin levels (partial correlation coefficient ≈0.50, P<0.001). In contrast to men, apoE2 homozygous women aged ≥50 years had significantly higher plasma lipid levels than their counterparts aged <50 years. These data demonstrate that the expression of type III HLP in E2/2 subjects is elicited to a large extent by hyperinsulinemia. In addition, in female apoE2 homozygotes, the expression increases with age; this increase is most likely due to the loss of estrogen production."

To quantify the yield losses caused by foliar diseases of alfalfa, field experiments were performed in Iowa, Ohio, Vermont, and Wisconsin from 1995 to 1998. Different fungicides and fungicide application frequencies were used to obtain different levels of foliar disease in alfalfa. Visual disease and remote sensing assessments were performed weekly to determine the relationships between disease assessments and alfalfa yield. Visual disease assessments of percentage of defoliation, disease incidence, and disease severity were performed weekly, approximately five to six times during each alfalfa growth cycle. Remote sensing assessments also were obtained weekly by measuring the percentage of sunlight reflected from alfalfa canopies using handheld, multispectral radiometers. Yield loss estimates were calculated as the yield difference between the fungicide treatment with the highest yield and the nonfungicide control, divided by the yield obtained from the highest yielding fungicide treatment × 100. Over the 4-year period, significant alfalfa yield losses (P≤ 0.05) occurred on 22 of the 48 harvest dates for the four states. The average significant yield loss for the 22 harvests was 19.3%. Both visual and percentage of reflectance assessments were used as independent variables in linear regression models to quantify the relationships between assessments and alfalfa yield. From 1995 to 1998, visual disease assessments were performed for a total of 209 dates and remote sensing assessments were performed on 198 dates from the four states. Yield models were developed for each of these assessment dates. There were 26/209, 26/209, and 17/209 significant yield models based on percentage of defoliation, disease incidence, and disease severity, respectively. Most of the significant models were for disease assessments performed on or within 1 or 2 weeks of the date of alfalfa harvest. When the significant models were averaged, percentage of defoliation, disease incidence, and disease severity explained 51, 55, and 52% of the variation in alfalfa yield, respectively. There were a total of 68/198 significant alfalfa yield models based on remote sensing assessments, and the significant models (averaged) explained 62% of the variation in alfalfa yield. Alfalfa foliar diseases continue to have a significant negative impact on alfalfa yields in the United States and remote sensing appears to offer a better means to quantify the impact of foliar diseases on alfalfa yield compared with visual assessment methods."

Summary Background Data: Many studies have reported a significant association between the degree of MVD-evaluated angiogenesis with the clinico pathologic factors and prognosis of patients with various solid tumors. All these studies were accomplished on tissue sections retrospectively obtained from surgical specimens. However, an in vivo method to assess tumor angiogenesis for human malignancies is highly desirable for diagnostic purpose, treatment planning, and follow-up. The CDVI is a new ultrasound parameter for evaluating in vivo angiogenesis, has a good correlation with status of lymph node metastasis in cervical carcinoma, and can predict distant metastasis and survival in colon cancer patients. Therefore, the CDVI may also be useful to assess in vivo angiogenesis in human gastric cancer. Methods: A total of 79 patients with gastric cancer were enrolled in this study, and microvessel density was evaluated by using immunohistochemical staining of surgical specimens with anti CD-34 antibody. Tumors were sonographically visible in 31 patients. The CDVI of each tumor was determined using transabdominal color Doppler ultrasound. The CDVI was defined as the ratio of the number of the colored pixels within a tumor section to the number of total pixels in that specific tumor section, and was calculated by using Encomate software (Electronic Business Machine Co. Ltd., Taipei, Taiwan). Correlation between MVD, CDVI and clinicopathologic factors and patient survival was studied. Results: The MVD was significantly correlated with vascular invasion by multiple linear regression analysis. Although the survival of patients with high MVD (> 32) was significantly worse than those with low MVD (< 32) by univariate analysis, vascular invasion was an independent prognostic factor by Cox proportional hazard model. There was a linear correlation between CDVI and MVD (r = .495, P = .005). Moreover, in patients with a high CDVI (> 11%), the survival rate was significantly lower than that in those with low CDVI (≤ 11%, P = .005). None of the patients with high CDVI (> 11%) survived 2 years after curative resection. In addition to vascular invasion, the CDVI was another independent prognostic factor in the patients with stage III gastric cancer. Conclusions: Vascular invasion was an important prognostic indicator in gastric cancer. The high CDVI was a good preoperative indicator of early death in stage III gastric cancer patients. Thus, the CDVI may be helpful in selecting patients with gastric cancer for neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or anti-angiogenic therapy."

Clinically, all patients showed chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO). The size of deletions varied between 2.5 and 9 kb, and heteroplasmy between 31% and 94%. In patients with single deletions, the citrate synthase (CS) activity was nearly doubled. Decreased ratios of pyruvate- and succinate-dependent respiration were detected in fibers of all patients in comparison to controls. Inverse and linear correlations without thresholds were established between heteroplasmy and (i) CS referenced activities of the complexes of respiratory chain, (ii) CS referenced maximal respiratory rates, (iii) and cytochrome-c-oxidase (COX) negative fibers. In patients with single and multiple deletions, all respiratory chain complexes as well as the respiratory rates were decreased to a similar extent. All changes detected in patients with single deletions were independent of deletion size. In one patient, only genes of ND5, ND4L as well as tRNALeu(CUN), tRNASer(AGY), and tRNAHis were deleted. The pronounced decrease in COX activity in this patient points to the high pathological impact of these missing tRNA genes. The activity of nuclear encoded SDH was also significantly decreased in patients, but to a lesser extent. This is an indication of secondary disturbances of mitochondria at CPEO. In conclusion, we have shown that different deletions cause mitochondrial impairments of the same phenotype correlating with heteroplasmy. The missing threshold at the level of mitochondrial function seems to be characteristic for large-scale deletions were tRNA and protein genes are deleted. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

We investigated cardiovascular and all-cause mortality patterns in age-group 75-84 years in Europe in the period 1970-1996. Methods: Mortality data for the age-group 75-84 years were obtained from WHO and standardized according to the old European population standard. Tables were produced showing mortality rates per country around the year 1995 and trends were calculated over the period 1970-1996 using linear regression analysis. Results: In both men and women aged 75-84 all-cause and cardiovascular mortality rates were higher in Central and Eastern Europe compared with Western Europe. For the last 3 available years, all-cause mortality rates differed by a factor 2/2·5 (men, women) when comparing the country with the highest with that of the lowest rate. For total cardiovascular mortality this factor was about 4/5 (men, women). During the period 1970-1996, all-cause and total cardiovascular mortality rates declined in most European countries. The decline in all causes of mortality was almost exclusively due to a decline in total cardiovascular disease mortality, especially stroke. Increases in total cardiovascular mortality were observed in some central European countries and Greece. Conclusion: Major changes, mainly a decline, occurred in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in subjects aged 75-84 in Europe.

Most adults with and without asthma had detectable serum cotinine levels, indicating recent ETS exposure (85.7% and 83.4%, respectively). Among nonsmoking male participants, I found no evidence that ETS exposure was related to decreased pulmonary function. In the nonsmoking female stratum, the highest cotinine tertile was associated with a lower FEV1 [-100 mL; 95% confidence interval (CI), -143 to -56 mL], FVC (-119 mL; 95% CI, -168 to -69 mL), and FEV1/FVC ratio (-1.77%; 95% CI, -2.18% to -1.36%). Among women with asthma, the highest continine tertile was also associated with decreased FEV1 (-261 mL; 95% CI, -492 to -30mL), FVC (-291 mL; 95% CI, -601 to 20 mL), and FEV1/FVC ratio (-1.6%; 95% CI, -3.3% to 0.19%). In conclusion, ETS exposure is associated with decreased pulmonary function in adult females, especially those with asthma. This analysis should provide further impetus for public policies that promote smoke-free environments."

During the following 3 weeks (test period), they were divided into four dietary groups with 0.5% (LA), 1.2% (LM), 1.8% (ML) or 2.4% (M) myristic acid. Finally, half the hamsters in each group were again fed the LA diet for another 3 weeks (post-period). At the end of the test period, the hepatic expression of the scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) was lower in the LM, ML and M group than in the LA group whereas the hepatic cholesteryl ester concentration was higher. Cholesterol 7α hydroxylase activity was lower in the ML and M groups than in the LA and LM groups while the sterol 27 hydroxylase and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase activities were not modulated by dietary myristic acid. This is the first time a negative correlation has been observed between the HDL-cholesterol concentration and the hepatic mass of SR-BI (r -0.69; P<0.0001) under physiological conditions. An inverse linear regression was also shown between SR-BI and the percentage of myristic acid in the diet (r -0.75; P<0.0001). The hepatic mass of SR-BI in the M group had increased at the end of the post-period compared with the test-period values. The present investigation shows that myristic acid modulates HDL-cholesterol via a regulation of the SR-BI expression."

Four barrows, average initial body weight of 25 kg, were fitted with a T-cannula and fed four diets according to a 4 x 4 Latin square design. Four cornstarch-based diets, containing four levels of P at 0.7, 1.5, 2.2 and 2.8 g/kg dry matter intake (DMI), were formulated from corn. Each experimental period comprised 8 d with 4-d adaptation and 4-d collection of ileal digesta and fecal samples. The apparent ileal and fecal P digestibility values in corn were affected (P < 0.05) by P contents in the assay diets. The apparent ileal and fecal P digestibility values increased from -51.0 to 33.3% and from -41.4 to 39.1%, respectively, as P content increased from 0.7 to 2.8 g/kg DMI. Linear relationships (P < 0.05), expressed as g/kg DMI, between the apparent ileal and fecal digestible P and the total intake of dietary P, suggested that true P digestibility and the endogenous P outputs associated with corn can be determined by the regression analysis technique. There were no differences (P > 0.05) in true P digestibility values (54.0 ± 6.5 vs. 59.8 ± 8.5%) and the endogenous P outputs (0.693 ± 0.128 vs. 0.670 ± 0.160 g/kg DMI) between the ileal and the fecal determinations. The endogenous fecal P output represented 12.3% and 25.8% of the daily total and available P requirements in growing pigs recommended by the National Research Council in 1998. The present literature data of apparent digestibility and availability underestimate the true digestive utilization of P in corn for growing pigs by ∼35%.

There were no differences in the pooled regression coefficients between males and females combining all studies; the regression of blood pressure on birth weight for males was -1.27 (95% confidence interval: -1.77, -0.77) mmHg/kg and for females was -1.24 (95% confidence interval: -1.90, -0.58) mmHg/kg. When studies in which blood pressure had been measured in childhood were considered separately from those in which it was measured in adulthood, there were no sex differences in either age group.

This finding, in addition to the disparity between %HRR and %V̇O2max which is greater at low intensities and among low fit individuals, led the American College of Sports Medicine to adopt the use of %V̇O2R in place of %V̇O2max when prescribing exercise intensity among healthy adults and persons with heart disease. However, the relationship of %HRR to %V̇O2R among persons with heart disease has not been described. Purpose: Among patients with a myocardial infarction (MI) and patients with chronic heart failure (HF), test the hypothesis that %V̇O2R is equivalent to %HRR, while %V̇O2peak is not. Methods: Using a clinical cardiology outcomes database, symptom-limited treadmill tests from 65 patients with MI and 72 patients with HF were identified. Heart rate and V̇O2 data were measured continuously and averaged every 15 s. For each subject, linear regression was used to calculate the slope and y-intercept of %HRR versus %V̇O2R (assuming rest V̇O2 = 3.5 mL·kg-1·min-1) and %HRR versus %V̇O2peak. Mean slope and y-intercept were calculated for each group and compared with the line of identity (slope = 1, y-intercept = 0). Results: For the MI and HF groups, the slope of %HRR versus %V̇O2R was 0.96 ± 0.02 (±SE; P = NS. slope vs 1) and 0.97 ± 0.02(P = NS), respectively. And the y-intercept was - 1.9 ± 2.1% (P = NS, y-intercept vs 0) and -5.9 ± 2.1% (P < 0.05) for MI and HF, respectively. For both patient groups, the regression of %HRR versus %V̇O2peak resulted in a line that differed (P < 0.001) in both slope and y-intercept from the line of identity. Conclusions: In patients with heart disease, %HRR is a better estimate of %V̇O2R than %V̇O2peak. This finding does not affect the current recommended use of %HRR. However, when prescribing exercise based on V̇O2, relative intensity should be expressed as %V̇O2R."

Methods: A ""virtual eye"" was developed to simulate series of sensitivities over time at a given point in the eye. The user can input the actual behaviour of the point (for example, stable or deteriorating steadily), and then a configurable amount of noise is added to produce a realistic series over time. The advantage of this over using patient data is that the actual status of the eye is known. Series were generated using different frequencies of testing, and the diagnosis that would have been made from each series was compared with the true status of the eye. A point was diagnosed as progressing if the regression line for the series showed a deterioration of at least 1 dB per year, significant at the 1% level. From these results, graphs were produced showing the number of points correctly or incorrectly diagnosed as progressing. Results: With the virtual eye deteriorating at a rate of 2 dB/year, it was found that the point was determined to be progressing quicker when more tests were carried out each year. With a stable virtual eye, it was found that increasing the frequency of testing increased the number of series that were falsely labelled as progressing during the first 3 years of testing. Conclusions: As the frequency of testing increases, the sensitivity of PLR increases. However, the specificity decreases; possibly meaning more unnecessary changes in treatment. Three tests per year provide a good compromise between sensitivity and specificity."

Methods: This observational study was conducted in the medical wards of the Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland. A random sample of 371 patients was drawn from the 1084 patients discharged alive with a principal diagnosis of CHF between January 1997 and December 1998. Explicit criteria grouped into three scores were used to assess the quality of processes of care: admission work-up (admission score); evaluation and treatment during the stay (treatment score); and readiness for discharge (discharge score). The association between LOS and quality of care was analysed using linear regression with adjustment for clinical characteristics. Results: The mean proportion of criteria met were 80% for the admission score, 66% for the treatment score, and 76% for the discharge score. Mean (SD) LOS was 13.2 (8.8) days. The admission score was not associated with LOS, but the treatment score increased by 0.5% (95% CI 0.3 to 0.7; p<0.001) with each additional day in hospital and the discharge score increased by 2.5% (95% CI 1.6 to 3.3; p<0.001) per day from admission to day 10 but remained unchanged thereafter. Adjustment for potential confounders did not substantially modify these relationships. Conclusions: In patients with CHF there is a significant association between LOS and the quality of the treatment provided, as well as with readiness for discharge. Appropriate reorganisation of processes of care should accompany attempts at reducing LOS to avoid detrimental effects on quality of care."

Linear regression (LR) and artificial neural network (NN) models were used to identify the cool-season precipitation signal in tree rings. Using 1931-88 records, the stepwise LR model was cross-validated with a leave-one-out procedure and the NN was validated with a bootstrap technique. The final models were also independently validated using the 1896-1930 precipitation data. In most of the climate divisions, both techniques can successfully reconstruct dry and normal years, and the NN seems to capture large precipitation events and more variability better than the LR. In the 1000 year reconstructions the NN also produces more distinctive wet events and more variability, whereas the LR produces more distinctive dry events. The 1000 year reconstructed precipitation from the two models shows several sustained dry and wet periods comparable to the 1950s drought (e.g. 16th century mega drought) and to the post-1976 wet period (e.g. 1330s, 1610s). The impact of extreme periods on the environment may be stronger during sudden reversals from dry to wet, which were not uncommon throughout the millennium, such as the 1610s wet interval that followed the 16th century mega drought. The instrumental records suggest that strong dry to wet precipitation reversals in the past 1000 years might be linked to strong shifts from cold to warm El Niño-southern oscillation events and from a negative to positive Pacific decadal oscillation. © 2002 Royal Meteorological Society."

For response, different final multivariate models were obtained from forward and backward selection methods, suggesting a disconcerting instability. Quality of life was measured using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire completed by patients. Subscales on the questionnaire are known to be highly correlated, and therefore it was hypothesized that multicollinearity contributed to model instability. A correlation matrix indicated that global QL was highly correlated with 7 out of 11 variables. In a first attempt to explore multicollinearity, we used global QL as dependent variable in a regression model with other QL subscales as predictors. Afterwards, standard diagnostic tests for multicollinearity were performed. An exploratory principal components analysis and factor analysis of the QL subscales identified at most three important components and indicated that inclusion of global QL made minimal difference to the loadings on each component, suggesting that it is redundant in the model. In a second approach, we advocate a bootstrap technique to assess the stability of the models. Based on these analyses and since global QL exacerbates problems of multicollinearity, we therefore recommend that global QL be excluded from prognostic factor analyses using the QLQ-C30. The prognostic factor analysis was rerun without global QL in the model, and selected the same significant prognostic factors as before. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

In this study imaging test utilization rates were analyzed in a contemporary group of patients, and clinical and demographic predictors of testing were identified. Materials and Methods: Data were abstracted from the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE), a longitudinal registry of men with various stages of prostate cancer. A total of 4,966 men met study inclusion criteria of available treatment and staging data. The rates of computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and bone scans performed between the dates of diagnosis and primary treatment were analyzed in patients at 3 levels of clinical risk based on serum prostate specific antigen, Gleason sum and T stage. Time trends in test utilization were analyzed by linear regression. Contemporary rates were compared with those identified in a previous analysis of an earlier CaPSURE cohort. Demographic and clinical predictors of utilization were identified using generalized linear model analysis. Results: Since June 1997, the overall use of staging tests has decreased 63%, 25.9% and 11.4% in patients at low, intermediate and high risk, respectively. The most precipitous decrease was noted for bone scan but the use of cross-sectional imaging also decreased in all groups. Utilization rates were lower in 2001 than in any other year studied in CaPSURE. Conclusions: The rates of testing decreased significantly in all risk groups. However, in the absence of established clinical practice guidelines many patients at low and intermediate risk continue to undergo unnecessary testing, while a growing number of those at high risk are proceeding to treatment without previous imaging."

Its extension to the regression SVM-the maximal inconsistency algorithm-has been recently presented by the author (Laskov, 2000, Solla, Leen, & Müller (Eds.)

A detailed account of both algorithms is carried out, complemented by theoretical investigation of the relationship between the two algorithms. It is proved that the two algorithms are equivalent for the pattern recognition SVM, and the feasible direction interpretation of the maximal inconsistency algorithm is given for the regression SVM. The experimental results demonstrate an order of magnitude decrease of training time in comparison with training without decomposition, and, most importantly, provide experimental evidence of the linear convergence rate of the feasible direction decomposition algorithms."

Results: The annual reductions in forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expired volume in one second (FEV1) were 0.91 (SD 1.22) and 0.84 (SD 1.28) per cent per year in divers, which were significantly higher than the reductions in the policemen of 0.24 (SD 1.04) and 0.16 (SD 1.07) per cent per year (p < 0.001). The annual reduction in the maximal expiratory flow rotes at 25% and 75% of FVC expired (FEF25% and FEF75%) were related to the log10 transformed cumulative number of dives in a multiple regression analysis (p < 0.05). The annual reductions in TICO were 1.33 (SD 1.85) and 0.43 (SD 1.53) per cent per year in divers and policemen (p < 0.05). Conclusions: FVC, FEV1, maximal expiratory flow rates, and TICO were significantly reduced in divers over the follow up period when compared with policemen. The contrasts within and between groups suggest that diving has contributed to the reduction in lung function."

Fifteen chemicals known to induce contact hypersensitivity reactions in man, including various thiuram, carbamate, and benzothiazole compounds, and one amine were tested. The EC3 (effective concentration inducing a 3-fold increase in proliferation of lymph node cells Stimulation Index, SI = 3) was calculated with non-linear regression analysis, including a bootstrap method for determination of the 5-95% confidence interval of the EC3 value. This procedure identified 14 out of the 15 chemicals tested as sensitizers, while for one chemical, ZDBC, no EC3 could be calculated due to low responses and a lack of a dose-response relationship in the data obtained. The ranking order of the chemicals with increasing EC3 values (and thus decreasing allergenic potency) was found to be in the following order: ZDEC < TMTD < TETD < ZPC < ZDMC < MBTS < PTD < TMTM < MBT < MBI < PTT < ZMBT < TBTD < DEA < ZDBC. Our results indicate that the chemicals of choice for use in the production of natural rubber latex products would be for the thiuram compounds, TBTD; for the carbamates, ZDBC; and for the benzothiazoles, ZMBT. However, one has to be aware that besides potency, the total amount of residual chemical present in the final product is also important for allergy induction. © Oxford University Press 2002."

We describe the development and comparison of a psychometric questionnaire on patient satisfaction with anaesthesia care among six hospitals. Methods. We used a rigorous protocol: generation of items, construction of the pilot questionnaire, pilot study, statistical analysis (construct validity, factor analysis, reliability analysis), compilation of the final questionnaire, main study, repeated analysis of construct validity and reliability. We compared the mean total problem score and the scores for the dimensions: 'Information/involvement in decision-making', and 'Continuity of personal care by anaesthetist'. The influence of potential confounding variables was tested (multiple linear regression). Results. The average problem score from all hospitals was 18.6%. Most problems are mentioned in the dimensions 'Information/involvement in decision-making' (mean problem score: 30.9%) and 'Continuity of personal care by anaesthetist' (mean problem score: 32.2%). The overall assessment of the quality of anaesthesia care was good to excellent in 98.7% of cases. The most important dimension was 'Information/Involvement in decision-making'. The mean total problem score was significantly lower for two hospitals than the total mean for all hospitals (significantly higher at two hospitals) (P<0.05). Amongst the confounding variables considered, age, sex, subjective state of health, type of anaesthesia and level of education had an influence on the total problem score and the two dimensions mentioned. There were only marginal differences with and without the influence of the confounding variables for the different hospitals. Conclusions. A psychometric questionnaire on patient satisfaction with anaesthesia care must cover areas such as patient information, involvement in decision-making, and contact with the anaesthetist. The assessment using summed scores for dimensions is more informative than a global summed rating. There were significant differences between hospitals. Moreover, the high problem scores indicate a great potential for improvement at all hospitals."

Determinants and specifically the relative contribution of prenatal and postnatal factors to growth and nutritional status of Indonesian infants were investigated. Newborn infants, from women recruited at ∼18 wk of pregnancy from 9 rural villages in West Java, Indonesia, were followed until 12-15 mo of age. Weight, length, morbidity, breast-feeding and food intake were assessed monthly. Determinants of length and weight increase and nutritional status reflected by Z-scores were evaluated using multiple linear regression. Neonatal weight (3.2 ± 0.5 kg) and length (49.7 ± 2.2 cm) were reasonable. However, growth started to falter at 6-7 mo of age, resulting in prevalences of 24% stunting and 32% underweight at 12 mo of age. The multiple regression models explained 19-41% of the variation in growth and nutritional status of infants. Neonatal weight (β = 0.285) and length (β = 0.492) were the strongest positive predictors of weight-for-age and height-for-age Z-scores, respectively. Fever was negatively associated with weight increase (β = -0.144) and weight-for-age (β = -0.142) and weight-for-height Z-scores (β = -0.255) but not with length increase or height-for-age Z-scores. Intake of complementary foods was positively associated with increases in weight (β = 0.190) and length (β = 0.179) and nutritional status of infants (β = 0.136-0.194). In conclusion, in this rural population in West Java, neonatal weight and especially length, reflecting the prenatal environment, are the most important predictors of infant nutritional status."

Materials and methods: Artificial gaps were created in 40 borosilicate glass cylinders, each 5 mm deep and with an internal diameter of 5.5 mm. Half of the internal bonding surface of each cylinder was sandblasted, silanised and coated with a dentine adhesive (Primer&Bond NT, Dentsply). Twenty partially bonded cylinders were incrementally filled with Dyract AP (AP) and the rest with Spectrum (S). For each material, 10 specimens were stored in de-ionised water (W), and 10 (control) in non-aqueous silicone fluid (O) at 37°C. The dimension of the same maximum gap created in each specimen was repeatedly measured at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 weeks, using a light microscope under incident light at 570x magnification. Gap widths in each of the four groups (n = 10) were statistically compared. Correlations between mean gap width reduction and storage time were also examined. Results: Friedman repeated measures ANOVA on ranks revealed significant differences (p < 0.001) among the gap widths measured at different time intervals in groups AP-W and S-W. No significant differences (p > 0.05) were found in groups AP-O and S-O. Tukey's multiple comparison test indicated that no significant differences (p > 0.05) were detectable beyond the sixth week in AP-W and the fourth week in S-W. Linear regression analyses showed that mean gap widths decreased exponentially with time for AP-W (r = 0.97) and S-W (r = 0.90). From the slopes of the regression lines, the rate of marginal gap reduction in AP-W was 4.6 times faster than S-W. Conclusion: Marginal gap reduction in both the materials are directly attributed to water sorption and that the reduction is larger and more rapid in Dyract AP. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Methods - In 1111 cases (452 men, 659 women) aged 63±10 years old (range, 40 to 94 years) recruited from a population-based survey performed in 1999, we measured fasting plasma total homocysteine levels and performed bilateral carotid B-mode ultrasound. The participants underwent measurements of other blood chemistries (total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c, and creatinine). Results - For the total population, the mean total homocysteine level was 10.9 μmol/L. Total homocysteine levels were higher in men than in women and increased with aging. With multiple linear regression analysis after adjustments for age and sex, the most powerful determinant of total homocysteine levels was serum creatinine (P<0.001). With multiple stepwise regression analysis after adjustments for age, sex, and other confounding factors, total homocysteine was significantly (P<0.05) related to IMT. Furthermore, when mean values of IMT adjusted for age, sex, and other related factors were analyzed across total homocysteine quartiles, IMT (P<0.05) showed a significant trend as total homocysteine level increased. Conclusions - Plasma total homocysteine levels in Japan are similar to those reported in western countries. Mild hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for increased carotid artery wall thickness in Japan as well."

However, their pathophysiological basis is poorly understood. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) may provide the means to investigate early changes in brain metabolite concentrations. We examined the relationships between N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), choline (Cho) and creatine (Cr) metabolite ratios in a voxel in the parietal cortex and cognitive function in 88 healthy, non-demented, unmedicated men aged 65-70 years. We also used linear regression to give a value for each metabolite adjusted for the levels of the other two metabolites. Both NAA/ Cr and Cho/Cr ratios correlated positively with tests of verbal memory and a verbal memory factor (e.g. NAA/ Cr and Logical Memory: r = 0.24, P < 0.05). Cho/Cr ratios also correlated positively with tests of visual memory (e.g. visual reproduction: r = 0.21, P < 0.05). Adjusted Cr levels correlated negatively and significantly with tests of verbal memory and the Verbal Memory Factor. The regression analysis suggested that Cr levels better explained the correlations between NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr ratios and cognitive variables than NAA or Cho levels. These results suggest that in healthy men aged 65-70 years, metabolite levels relate to cognitive performance. Rising Cr levels may be an early marker of cognitive decline."

The authors evaluated the use of a limited sampling scheme, using different assay techniques to determine the reproducibility of such a strategy in estimating midazolam AUC. Seventy-three healthy adults received midazolam as a single intravenous bolus dose. At least eight plasma samples were collected from each subject and were assayed using either LC/MS/MS or electron capture gas chromatography. Eleven subjects were randomly selected for the training set using stepwise linear regression to determine relationships between midazolam plasma concentrations and AUC. Validation of the predictive equations was done using the remaining 62 subjects. Mean percent error (MPE), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE) were calculated to determine bias and precision. Based on the training set, five models were generated with coefficients of determination ranging from 0.87 to 0.95. Validation showed that MPE, MAE, and RMSE values were acceptable for three of the models. Intrasubject reproducibility was good. In addition, training set data from one institution were able to predict data from the other two institutions using other assay techniques. Minimized plasma sampling may provide a simpler method for estimating midazolam AUC for CYP3A phenotyping. A limited sampling strategy is more convenient and cost-effective than standard sampling strategies and is applicable to more than one assay technique. © 2002 the American College of Clinical Pharmacology."

A cross-sectional survey of 128 patients who had been on hemodialysis for more than 6 months was conducted. Baseline information on demographic factors and detailed clinical information was collected. Average Kt/V levels (for the 3 months preceding HRQOL assessment) were determined.

The objective of this study was to characterize the in vitro susceptibility profiles of a large panel of clinically derived HIV-1 isolates for tenofovir. The distribution of tenofovir susceptibilities in over 1,000 antiretroviral-naive, HIV-1-infected individuals worldwide was determined using the Virco Antivirogram assay. In addition, phenotypic susceptibilities to tenofovir and other RT inhibitors were determined in a panel of nearly 5,000 recombinant HIV-1 clinical isolates from predominantly treatment-experienced patients analyzed as a part of routine drug resistance testing. Greater than 97.5% of isolates from treatment-naive patients had tenofovir susceptibilities <3-fold above those of the wild-type controls by the Antivirogram. The clinically derived panel of 5,000 samples exhibited a broad range of antiretroviral drug susceptibilities, including 69, 43, and 16% having >10-fold-decreased susceptibilities to at least one, two, and three antiretroviral drug classes, respectively. Greater than 88% of these 5,000 clinical isolates were within the threefold susceptibility range for tenofovir, and >99% exhibited <10-fold-reduced susceptibilities to tenofovir. Decreased susceptibility to tenofovir was not directly associated with resistance to other RT inhibitors; r2 values of log-log linear regression plots of susceptibility to tenofovir versus susceptibility to other RT inhibitors were <0.4. The results suggest that the majority of treatment-naive and treatment-experienced individuals harbor HIV that remains within the normal range of tenofovir susceptibilities and may be susceptible to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate therapy."

However, data regarding such associations are limited for Asians. This study examined associations between tHcy levels and severity of carotid atherosclerosis in Japanese subjects. Additionally, because lacunar infarction is the most prevalent type of ischemic stroke in Japan, we also investigated its associations with tHcy levels. Methods - The subjects were 152 Japanese patients (age, 66.2±11.0 years) at our hospital. Using ultrasound, we evaluated severity of carotid atherosclerosis by plaque score, which is defined by the sum of all plaque (intima-media thickness ≥1.1 mm) height in bilateral carotid arteries. In 112 of 152 patients, the existence of lacunar infarction was evaluated on brain MRI scans. Results - A moderate linear association was found between tHcy levels and plaque score (r=0.48, P<0.0001). Moreover, tHcy level was associated with plaque score (β=0.26, P<0.001) independently of traditional atherosclerotic risk factors. In logistic regression analyses, each 1-μmol/L-higher tHcy level was associated with a 1.37-fold-higher [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.19 to 1.58] likelihood for lacunar infarction, increasing the likelihood by 1.22-fold (95% CI, 1.04 to 1.43) independently of traditional atherosclerotic risk factors. Conclusions - Higher tHcy levels appear to have associations with increased severity of carotid atherosclerotic plaques and prevalent lacunar infarction in the Japanese. Larger prospective studies are necessary to establish whether higher tHcy levels serve as a harbinger for insidious carotid and cerebrovascular diseases."

The ensemble regression function consists of linear combinations of base hypotheses generated by some boosting-type base learning algorithm. Unlike the classification case, for regression the set of possible hypotheses producible by the base learning algorithm may be infinite. We explicitly tackle the issue of how to define and solve ensemble regression when the hypothesis space is infinite. Our approach is based on a semi-infinite linear program that has an infinite number of constraints and a finite number of variables. We show that the regression problem is well posed for infinite hypothesis spaces in both the primal and dual spaces. Most importantly, we prove there exists an optimal solution to the infinite hypothesis space problem consisting of a finite number of hypothesis. We propose two algorithms for solving the infinite and finite hypothesis problems. One uses a column generation simplex-type algorithm and the other adopts an exponential barrier approach. Furthermore, we give sufficient conditions for the base learning algorithm and the hypothesis set to be used for infinite regression ensembles. Computational results show that these methods are extremely promising."

The cohort included 57,613 workers employed for at least 1 year in the pulp and paper industry in 12 countries. We assessed exposure to SO2 at the level of mill and department, using industrial hygiene measurement data and information from company questionnaires; 40,704 workers were classified as exposed to SO2. We conducted a standardized mortality ratio (SMR) analysis based on age-specific and calendar period-specific national mortality rates. We also conducted a Poisson regression analysis to determine the dose-response relations between SO2 exposure and cancer mortality risks and to explore the effect of potential confounding factors. The SMR analysis showed a moderate deficit of all causes of death [SMR = 0.89; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.87-0.96] among exposed workers. Lung cancer mortality was marginally increased among exposed workers (SMR = 1.08; 95% CI, 0.98-1.18). After adjustment for occupational coexposures, the lung cancer risk was increased compared with unexposed workers (rate ratio = 1.49; 95% CI, 1.14-1.96). There was a suggestion of a positive relationship between weighted cumulative SO2 exposure and lung cancer mortality (p-value of test for linear trend = 0.009 among all exposed workers; p = 0.3 among workers with high exposure). Neither duration of exposure nor time since first exposure was associated with lung cancer mortality. Mortality from non-Hodgkin lymphoma and from leukemia was increased among workers with high SO2 exposure; a dose-response relationship with cumulative SO2 exposure was suggested for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. For the other causes of death, there was no evidence of increased mortality associated with exposure to SO2. Although residual confounding may have occurred, our results suggest that occupational exposure to SO2 in the pulp and paper industry may be associated with an increased risk of lung cancer."

The aim of this study was to investigate factors influencing chronic endothelial cell loss in a homogeneous group of patients. Methods: 177 patients after first normal risk keratoplasties for keratoconus were retrospectively selected from the quality control database of our clinic. For 71 of them at least four central endothelial cell density values were documented in follow up. From these patients, only those 53 without any further intraocular procedures, without glaucoma, and without graft rejection were considered. A scatter plot of logarithmised endothelial cell density values against postoperative time was drawn for each patient. The slope of the regression line then equals the constant of decay in central endothelial cell density. The influence of donor age and storage time in organ culture on this index value of cell loss was investigated by means of linear regression analysis. Results: Mean loss of central endothelial cell density was 16.7% per year. Regression analysis revealed a statistically significant negative linear effect of both postmortem time (β = -0.324; p = 0.014) and donor age (β = -0.282; p = 0.036) and a trend for storage time in organ culture (β = -0.195; p = 0.142) in a combined linear regression model. Conclusion: Increased postmortem time and advanced donor age exert a significant negative effect on chronic endothelial cell loss. Storage time in organ culture seems to be third influencing factor. These negative influences may be reduced by compensating advanced donor age with minimised postmortem and storage time."

Genetic parameters were calculated with data from cows that had an opportunity to reach 84 mo of age (n = 18, 725). Linear type traits were preadjusted for stage of lactation and age at classification. True herd life was preadjusted for age at first calving and for functional herd life, within herd-year quartile ranking for milk yield.

Furthermore, the behaviour of serum levels of these hormones during an acute inflammatory stressful disease state is not well known. Subjects and methods: In this study in patients with an acute inflammatory stressful disease state (13 patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery) and patients with chronic inflammation (61 patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)) vs 120 controls, we aimed to investigate adrenal hormone shifts looking at serum levels of DHEA in relation to other adrenal hormones. Furthermore, we tested the predictive role of serum tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) for a change of serum levels of DHEA in relation to other adrenal hormones. Results: The molar ratio of serum levels of DHEA/androstenedione (ASD) was increased in patients with an acute inflammatory stressful disease state and was decreased in patients with chronic inflammation. The molar ratio of serum levels of DHEAS/DHEA was reduced during an acute inflammatory stressful disease state and was increased in patients with chronic inflammation. A multiple linear regression analysis revealed that elevated serum levels of TNF were associated with a high ratio of serum levels of DHEA/ASD in all groups (for IL-6 in patients with an acute inflammatory stressful disease state only), and, similarly, elevated serum levels of TNF were associated with a high ratio of serum levels of DHEAS/DHEA only in IBD (for IL-6 only in healthy subjects). Conclusions: This study indicates that changes of serum levels of DHEA in relation to serum levels of other adrenal hormones are completely different in patients with an acute inflammatory stressful disease state compared with patients with chronic inflammation. The decrease of serum levels of DHEAS and DHEA is typical for chronic inflammation and TNF and IL-6 play a predictive role for these changes."

A hyphenated instrument generates for each specimen a two-way array of data. These are assumed to depend on the concentrations through a bilinear regression model, where each constituent is characterized by a pair of profiles to be determined in the calibration. We discuss the problem of predicting the unknown concentrations in a new specimen, after calibration. We formulate three different predictor construction methods, a 'naive' method, a least squares method, and a refined version of the latter that takes account of the calibration uncertainty. We give formulae for the uncertainty of the predictors under white noise, when calibration can be seen as precise. We refine these formulae to allow for calibration uncertainty, in particular when calibration is carried out by the bilinear least squares (BLLS) method or the singular value decomposition (SVD) method proposed by Linder and Sundberg (Chemometrics Intell. Lab. Syst. 1998; 42:159-178). By error propagation formulae and previous results on the precision of A and B we can obtain approximate standard errors for the predicted concentrations, according to each of the two estimation methods.

The information content was explored qualitatively by inspecting polarimetric colour composites, and by applying decomposition algorithms to the polarimetric covariance matrices at individual frequencies. Three families of quantitative models were fitted to estimate stem volume: (1) F1P1 models, using a single frequency and a single polarization; (2) F2P1 models, using the difference between HV polarization at C- and L-band related to stem volume; (3) F1P4 models, based on a single frequency and the full polarimetric information, selected by stepwise multiple regression with stem volume.

The L-band F1P4 models in March and May 1995 have the smallest rms errors, around 22 m3 ha-1. Three multiple regression models to retrieve snow water equivalent from back-scatter are presented: (1) EU model, an explorative, uncorrected multiple regression model; (2) EC model, an explorative, stem volume corrected multiple regression model; (3) CC model, a statistically conservative, stem volume corrected multiple regression model. The accuracy of snow water equivalent estimates was improved significantly by a simple linear correction for stem volume. The statistically conservative CC model showed that only L-band in HH polarization explained a significant (p<0.05) proportion of snow water equivalent (r2=0.51). The explorative EC model resulted in r2=0.68 (p>0.05). Conclusions are that (1) decomposition algorithms of the polarimetric covariance matrix result in information on scattering mechanisms in the vegetation canopy and on the ground, so being potentially of great value for land cover mapping; (2) satellite polarimetric SARs, for example those to be flown on Envisat and ALOS, will be able to estimate stem volume on continental and global scales; and (3) L-band SAR has a potential for snow cover mapping and runoff prediction."

CGTases are produced by a variety of bacteria, mainly Bacillus species, by submerged culture in complex medium. CGTases differ in the amount and types of CDs produced. In addition, CGTase production is highly dependent on the strain, medium composition and culture conditions. Therefore we undertook this study with a newly isolated strain of Bacillus circulans. Results: CGTase activity produced from Bacillus circulans DF 9R was optimised in shake flasks using a combination of conventional sequential techniques and statistical experimental design. Effects of nutrients, including several carbon, nitrogen and mineral sources, were assayed. The selected minimal medium consisted of 1.5 % cassava starch, 0.4 % ammonium sulphate, 0.1 M phosphate buffer, 0.002 % MgSO4 and 0.002 % FeSO4. The optimal concentrations of carbon and nitrogen sources were determined using a central composite design. Maximum CGTase activity obtained in supernatants was 5.8 U/mL in 48 h of incubation. Optimal conditions for enzyme production also included an initial pH of 8.3 and 37°C as the incubation temperature. Cell growth and CGTase production profile were not linked to each other, suggesting that enzyme production/secretion is not growth-associated but mainly a late-log phase event. Conclusion: We have screened conditions for optimal CGTase production. The selected minimal medium contained starch, ammonium, Mg2+ and Fe2+ as essential nutrients. As an additional advantage, this medium does not require complex nitrogen sources with varying and unknown composition. © 2002 Rosso et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

Many workers have believed in the multiplicative theory, whereby asbestos increases the risk in proportion to the risk from other causes. However, evidence against this theory is mounting: a recent review concluded that the multiplicative hypothesis was untenable, and that the relative risk of lung cancer from asbestos exposure was about twice as high in non-smokers as in smokers, a finding largely independent of type of asbestos fibre. The criteria for entry to the current study were met by 7279 men in the 1891-1920 birth cohort of Quebec chrysotile miners and millers. The data consisted of date of birth, place of employment, smoking habit, asbestos exposure accumulated to age 55 and, for those 5527 who died between 1950 and June 1992, date and cause of death; 533 of the deaths were from lung cancer. For the principal analyses, ex-smokers were excluded from the study cohort, which comprised 5888 men, of whom 473 died of lung cancer. The conventional form of analysis is simply of the double dichotomy: non-smokers of cigarettes, 'unexposed' and exposed; all others, 'unexposed' and exposed. The respective standardized lung cancer mortality ratios (SMRs) were 0.29 and 0.62; and 1.37 and 1.72. Thus, the differences in relative risk, due to exposure, were closely similar, 0.33 and 0.35. On the other hand, the effects of asbestos measured by the corresponding ratios, 2.12 and 1.25, did differ, being 1.7 times as high in non-smokers as in others. The principal analysis was much more penetrating: the method was to fit models to a 'disaggregated' 6 × 10 array, by smoking habit (excluding exsmokers) and asbestos exposure, of lung cancer SMRs. Both linear and log-linear models were fitted: the former included the additive and linear-multiplicative; the latter embraced the more conventional multiplicative form. The additive model fitted much the best. The fit of each multiplicative model was improved by the introduction of an interaction term that implied a less than multiplicative relationship. Thus smoking and exposure to chrysotile appear to have acted independently in causing lung cancer, with 10 cigarettes a day having an effect roughly equivalent to exposure amounting to 700 million particles per cubic foot x years. The refutation of the multiplicative hypothesis in these data reinforces its inapplicability in general; but the additive hypothesis is not generally applicable either. Indeed, there seems to be no good reason to believe that interactions conform to any simple theory. The implications are important."

Information concerning medication use in Asian haemodialysis patients is sparse. We surveyed prescribed medications and examined the relation between the number of medications and mortality and clinical characteristics in chronic haemodialysis patients, in Okinawa, Japan. Methods. We conducted a cross-sectional multicentre survey in August 1999 and patients were observed during 13 months of follow up. Results. The clinical demographics of 850 chronic haemodialysis patients in seven dialysis units were obtained. Compared with the mean number of medications prescribed in ambulatory patients treated in general practice reported from Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan (2.7 (n = 20 716)), the mean number medications in haemodialysis patients was larger (7.2 (n = 850)). The three most prescribed drug types in haemodialysis patients were those related to calcium and phosphate metabolism (88%), antihypertensive agents (71%), and erythropoietin (60%). Among the 850 patients, 38 died during the 13-month follow-up period. The number of medications was positively associated with mortality after adjusting for age, sex, and other clinical factors: the hazard ratio was 1.14 (95% confidence interval 1.03-1.26, P=0.007). A multiple linear regression analysis using the number of medications as a dependent factor and sex and other clinical characteristics as independent factors revealed that male sex (P = 0.04), diabetes mellitus (P < 0.0001), and duplication of drugs (P<0.0001) were positively correlated with the number of medications. Conclusions. Multiple drug use was observed in haemodialysis patients. The number of prescribed drugs was a significant predictor of short-term mortality. Male sex, diabetes mellitus, and duplication of drugs were correlated with increases in the number of medications."

Calcification and dysfunction of aortic and mitral valves are frequently found in chronic dialysis patients, but their influence on the development of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is not well defined. Methods. Conventional echocardiography and Doppler measurement of trans-aortic flow velocity were performed in 135 chronic haemodialysis patients, and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and trans-valve pressure gradients were calculated. Average values of systolic, diastolic and pulse pressure (PP), interdialytic weight gain, chronic overhydration (difference between mean post-dialysis and dry weights), plasma calcium, phosphate, haemoglobin, and urea reduction ratio over the year preceding this study were obtained in every patient. Results. Aortic valve calcification was present in 105 patients (78%), associated with stenosis in eight (6%); 39 patients (29%) had aortic regurgitation. Mitral annular calcification occurred in 35 (26%) cases and mitral regurgitation in 45 (33%). LVH was observed in 104 patients (77%). Logistic analysis revealed that only aortic valve calcification predicted LVH. LVMI was higher in patients with aortic valve calcification than in those without calcification: (mean ± SD) 241 ± 52 vs 154 ± 64 g/m2 P = 0.001. LVMI was not different between patients with normal, calcified, or regurgitating mitral valves. Patients with aortic valve calcification had higher trans-valve peak flow velocities and pressure gradients than those with non-calcified valves: 1.65 ± 0.53 vs 1.37 ± 0.33 m/s, P = 0.01, and 12.1 ± 8.9 vs 7.9 ± 3.6 mmHg, P=0.01, respectively. The LVMI correlated directly with both variables (r=0.27 and r=0.24, P<0.005). Stepwise linear regression on nine covariates potentially influencing LVMI (age, body mass index, time on dialysis, systolic blood pressure, PP, chronic overhydration, haemoglobin concentration, trans-aortic flow velocity, and urea reduction ratio) showed that LVMI was independently associated with (i) PP, (ii) haemoglobin (inverse correlation), (iii) peak aortic flow velocity, and (iv) chronic overhydration (r=0.502, R2 = 0.252, ANOVA F-ratio = 10. 19, P < 0.0005). Conclusion. Our findings show that aortic valve calcification is associated with LVH in chronic haemodialysis patients, probably because valve resistance to ventricular outflow is increased as shown by trans-aortic flow velocities and pressure gradients. The effect on LVMI is independent of PP, anaemia, and overhydration."

The clinical characteristics of patients who respond to reality orientation are poorly understood; this knowledge could be important, given that the provision of reality orientation therapy is labour-intensive and may provoke emotional distress. Aim: to evaluate retrospectively which demographic and clinical characteristics of Alzheimer's patients predict cognitive outcomes. Method: We analysed 38 mild-to-moderately demented outpatients who regularly attended a one-month formal reality orientation programme. The mini mental state examination score changes from baseline-and immediately after-reality orientation were correlated with demographic and pre-treatment clinical characteristics by a linear regression analysis. Results: Short-term responsiveness to reality orientation was significantly predicted by a lower level of cognitive functioning (as measured by the mini mental state examination) at baseline and by the absence of euphoria, accounting together for 57.6% of variance. Conclusion: A lower mini mental state examination and the absence of euphoric behaviour in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease may predict a good cognitive outcome of reality orientation therapy."

Thirty-two ASA I and II adult patients undergoing elective gynaecological surgery under low-thoracolumbar epidural block were studied. Eighteen patients received propofol (Group P: 20 mg bolus every 3 min) and 14 received midazolam (Group M: 0.5 mg bolus every 5 min) until an observer's assessment of alertness/sedation (OAA/S) scale score of I was achieved. AAI and BIS were monitored for different OAA/S scores. Results. AAI and BIS decreased and increased following the changes on the patients' OAA/S scores and correlated with sedation significantly. During the onset phase, the coefficients of Spearman's rank correlation for AAI and BIS were respectively 0.958 and 0.898 (P<0.001) for Group P, and 0.973 and 0.945 (P<0.001) for Group M. During the recovery phase in Group P, the coefficients were respectively 0.946 and 0.702 (P<0.001). Linear regression analysis showed that both AAI and BIS were linearly related to the OAA/S scores. The coefficients of Spearman's rank correlation and linear regression for AAI were all greater than those for BIS (P<0.05). Conclusions. Both AAI and BIS correlated well with the depth of sedation induced by propofol or midazolam under epidural block. AAI may be more valuable when monitoring depth of sedation."

Cephalo pelvic disproportion (CPD) has been attributed to short stature. It has been suggested that nutritional supplementation to promote linear growth would increase birthweight and the risk of CPD. The objective of this study was to examine the factors associated with CPD, with particular reference to birthweight, stature, parity and maternal age. Design. Factors associated with CPD were analyzed using data abstracted from a detailed early hospital report from Ibadan, Nigeria and from a recent rural pregnancy study conducted in the Shire Valley, Malawi. Results. In Nigeria, of 107 CPD cases admitted to hospital in Ibadan during 1953-54, 79% were women > 20 years. Birthweight values increased significantly with age and parity. In 19.6% of cases, the baby had a low birthweight (< 2500 g). In Malawi, among the 1523 women delivering, the incidence of CPD was 2.3%. Of the 35 cases of CPD, only four were adolescents. Birthweights increased with increasing parity, age and height (p < 0.001). In 6.4% of CPD cases, the baby had a low birthweight. Nulliparity (OR 4.0; CI 1.7-9.3; p = 0.0001), birthweight ≥ 3400 g (OR 4.6; CI 2.1-10.0; p = 0.0001) and height ≤ 154 cm (OR 3.8; CI 1.8-7.9; p = 0.0003) were associated with an increased risk of CPD. Adolescent mothers were less likely to experience CPD (OR 0.3; C.I. 0.8-0.9; p = 0.03). Conclusions. Adolescents are not at high risk of CPD. Nutritional supplementation of girls and adolescents should not be discouraged for fear of increasing the risk of CPD by improving birthweight. When CPD is present, it may result from childhood rickets and calcium deficiency."

Aims: We compared changes in hemodynamic variables vs. changes in symptoms of decompensated heart failure in patients enrolled in a randomized trial. Methods: We studied 201 patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IIIb or IV heart failure and ejection fraction ≤25% for ≥3 months. Patients underwent continuous monitoring by pulmonary-artery catheter during inpatient drug administration. We assessed the relations of changes in hemodynamic variables (baseline minus final measure) to changes at 2 weeks in congestive heart failure symptoms, NYHA class, Yale Dyspnea-Fatigue Index (YDFI) score, and distance achieved in a 6-min walk. Results: No hemodynamic measure significantly predicted either symptom score or NYHA classification. Mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure did show some relation to change in YDFI score in univariable, but not multivariable, analysis. No hemodynamic measure correlated significantly with changes in distance achieved in the 6-min walk test. Conclusion: We noted no significant association between improved hemodynamics and improved symptoms in patients with advanced heart failure.

A rapid method for the correction of CSF partial volume effects is described based on selective CSF imaging using long echo time (TE) fast spin echo (FSE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In order to achieve maximum suppression of signal from brain parenchyma, the FSE sequence is coupled with an inversion recovery (IR) pulse. Scan time is minimized using single shot (SS) IR-FSE. The method is validated against a current ""gold standard"" for the determination of CSF volumes, namely, segmented 3D spoiled gradient-echo (SPGR) scans. Excellent agreement in CSF percentage determined by the two methods was found (linear regression analysis: slope = 0.99 ± 0.02, intercept = 2.08 ± 0.45; mean ± standard errors, R = 0.93) in pooled data from four healthy subjects. An example of the use of SS-IR-FSE for partial volume correction in a leukodystrophy patient with T2 hyperintense lesions is demonstrated. SS-IR-FSE is a simple and rapid method for applying partial volume corrections in quantitative proton MRSI, which may be of particular value in the clinical environment when time constraints do not allow longer, perhaps more accurate segmentation methods to be used. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

High pulse pressure (PP) values have recently been implicated in the development and progression of large vessel atherosclerosis, small vessel disease, and in the occurrence of cardiovascular events. The aim of the present study is to investigate the relationship between PP and subclinical cardiovascular damage in a cohort of unselected middle-aged patients (204 male, 129 female) with untreated primary hypertension. Methods. PP was calculated as the difference between systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was assessed by M-B mode echocardiography (LVH = LVMI > 51 g/m2.7), and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) by high-resolution US scan. Albuminuria was measured as the albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) in three non-consecutive first morning urine samples. Results. PP was positively correlated to gender (P<0.05), duration of disease (P<0.001), age (P<0.0001), LDL cholesterol (P=0.007), and to early signs of target organ damage (TOD), namely LVMI (P<0.0001), IMT (P<0.0001), and ACR (P=0.036). Patients in the upper quartile of PP showed higher LVMI (P<0.001), thicker carotid walls (P<0.001), as well as higher ACR (P<0.04). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that PP and ACR independently influence LVMI (F= 26.476, r2 =0.29, P<0.0001) and IMT (F=17.813, r2 =0.26, P<0.0001). Patients with LVH, increased carotid IMT and microalbuminuria showed higher PP values as compared with those with lesser degrees of target organ involvement (F=4.97, P<0.003 inter-group comparison). Moreover, the risk of having the simultaneous occurrence of various signs of TOD increases significantly with each SD increase in PP or SBP, but is not influenced by DBP. Conclusions. PP is an independent marker of preclinical cardiovascular damage in relatively young patients with primary hypertension and, therefore, can be useful for identifying those at higher risk of cardiovascular events."

Objective: In this study we used a 24-h indicator amino acid oxidation and balance technique, with [1-13C]leucine as the indicator amino acid, to assess threonine adequacy at 6 test intakes (7, 11, 15, 19, 22, and 27 mg·kg-1·d-1) with a 6-d dietary adaptation phase in healthy, well-nourished Indian men. Design: Sixteen men were randomly allocated to 3 of 6 test intakes and were studied after 6 d of adaptation to the experimental diets. Diets were based on an L-amino acid mixture in which the threonine content was varied. At 1800 on day 6, a 24-h intravenous [13C]leucine tracer infusion protocol was conducted to assess 24-h leucine oxidation and daily leucine balances. Results: Leucine balances differed significantly (P = 0.02) between the different intakes of threonine. Two-phase linear regression analysis from 12-h and 24-h leucine oxidation and 24-h leucine balance gave a breakpoint at a threonine intake of 15 mg·kg-1·d-1, with 95% CIs ranging from 11 to 27 mg·kg-1·d-1. There was no significant effect of threonine intake on 24-h leucine flux. Conclusion: The results of the 24-h indicator amino acid oxidation and balance experiments indicate that the current FAO/WHO/UNU threonine recommendation of 7 mg·kg-1·d-1 is inadequate. A mean threonine intake of 15 mg·kg-1·d-1 is sufficient to achieve the indicator (leucine) amino acid balance in healthy Indian men."

The results were obtained from observations in the Maritime Continent Thunderstorm Experiment (MCTEX). Values were obtained of cirrus cloud backscatter coefficient, infrared (IR) emittance, optical depth and absorption coefficient, cloud height and depth, and back-scatter-to-extinction ratio. The values agree well with previous results obtained on equatorial cirrus in the Pilot Radiation Observation Experiment (PROBE) and extend those results to lower temperatures. Observations made of lidar linear depolarization ratio show similar trends to those observed in PROBE, extending those results to lower temperatures. Regressions of cloud IR emittance and absorption coefficients are performed as a preliminary tropical dataset for both cloud-resolving and climate models. These regressions are compared with previous regressions on midlatitude and tropical synoptic cirrus clouds. The IR absorption coefficients in tropical and equatorial cirrus appear to be larger than in midlatitude cirrus for temperatures less than -40°C, with the difference increasing toward low temperatures. Thus, a significantly different relationship may be appropriate for tropical cirrus compared to midlatitude cirrus clouds. Effective diameters of small particles in the colder tropical clouds are also measured using the ratio of visible extinction to infrared absorption. A new treatment of multiple scattering is used to correct the ratios. Effective diameters range from 6 to 9.3 μm at the colder temperatures."

For the moment, there is uncertainty about the usefulness of early treatment of localized prostate carcinoma, uncertainty about whether some patients with early cancer can be managed expectantly, and uncertainty about how such patients might be recognized. METHODS. The authors studied serial values of prostate specific antigen (PSA) in 94 Japanese men with diagnosed prostate carcinoma and who were managed by watchful waiting. Their median follow-up duration was 32 months (range, 1.6-118). The authors used a log-linear model to fit the values of PSA over time, and then they used the Cox survival model to relate the intercept (PSA amplitude) and slope (relative velocity) to observed local or systemic outcomes that were independent of PSA. RESULTS. The authors found that the log-linear model fit the serial values of PSA during watchful waiting very well. Prostate specific antigen amplitude related significantly to T classification (P = 0.0006), but not to grade (P > 0.2), and the relative velocity related significantly to both T classification (P = 0.009) and to grade (P = 0.02). Although the T classification, histologic grade, and log(PSA) at diagnosis were associated significantly with time to outcome, the combination of amplitude and relative velocity provided more information. These 2 PSA parameters resulted in a higher model likelihood ratio, and their individual P values in the Cox model were 0.0005 and 0.005, respectively. With these two in the Cox model, T classification, grade, log(PSA), and PSA doubling time provided no further significant information. CONCLUSIONS. A log-linear model seems to fit serial measurements of PSA during watchful waiting, and preliminary results suggest that both the amplitude and the relative velocity relate closely to clinical outcomes. © 2002 American Cancer Society."

Design To examine the effect of exercise training on skeletal muscle mitochondrial size in chronic heart failure patients. Methods Six heart failure patients participated in 16-weeks of supervised upper and lower extremity exercise training. At the conclusion of training, percutaneous needle biopsies of the vastus lateralis were taken and electron microscopy was used to assess mitochondrial sizes. Results The exercise programme resulted in a significant increase in peak maximal oxygen consumption (P < 0.05) and anaerobic threshold (P < 0.04). Knee extension muscle force increased following training (P < 0.02). After exercise training, the average size of the mitochondria increased by 23.4% (0.036 to 0.046 m2P < 0.015) and the average shape was unaltered. Conclusion Exercise training with heart failure patients alters skeletal muscle morphology by increasing mitochondrial size, with no change in shape. This may enhance oxidative metabolism resulting in an increased exercise tolerance. © 2002, European Society of Cardiology. All rights reserved."

It allows us to study in detail empirical relations between the magnitude and other focal parameters. In this study well-known relations combining two or three focal parameters, M = A + BIo + C log(H), Ms = D + EI0 + F log(H), ML = G + OI0 + P log(H), ML = Q + RMs + S log(H), are investigated (M, Kárnik's magnitude; ML, local magnitude; Ms, surface wave magnitude; I0, epicentral intensity; H, focal depth in kilometers). The data show a considerable scatter with respect to the relations above. The relations are considered useful, if the following significance criteria are fulfilled. (1) The data sets comprise a minimum of 20 entries. (2) The partial correlation between the two most important parameters is greater than 70 per cent. (3) The parameter of least importance still influences the correlation of the others by more than 5 per cent. The partial correlation coefficients help to decide whether the data are to be rejected as insufficient for the regression analysis or to determine the level beyond which it is useful to perform a regression analysis excluding the parameter of lowest importance. Two kinds of regression are carried out: (1) standard linear regression assumes that only M or ML, respectively, are in error, while the remaining two parameters are error-free. (2) Orthogonal regression assumes that all three parameters have errors. This is the case for the data in the catalogue used here. The orthogonal regression M = -1.682 + 0.654I0 + 1.868 log(H), with a standard deviation of ±0.284, differs considerably from Kárnik's empirical relation M = 0.5I0 + log(H) + 0.35 for shallow foci, but agrees well with the results of earlier studies by the authors for earthquakes in SE Europe. The data set M, I0, H (for H < 50 km) fails criterion (3). The orthogonal least-squares fit without log(H) has been found as follows: Ms = 0.550I0 + 1.260, with a standard deviation of ±0.412. We observe systematic regional deviations from this relationship, which need further investigation. The correlation analysis shows that ML and Ms are weakly linked with log(H), but the correlation between ML and Ms is very high (93 per cent). Therefore, the orthogonal relation between ML and Ms without the log(H) term was chosen: ML = 0.664 + 0.893 Ms, with a standard deviation of ±0.163. The correlations between ML, I0 and log(H) do not fulfil the significance criteria. For the purpose of earthquake hazard analysis the orthogonal regression visualizes simultaneously the errors of all input data, i.e. δMLi, δMi and δ log(Hi). Our new relationships result from orthogonal regression analysis using a large high-quality data set. They should be applicable in Central and Southern Europe unless there are regional relationships available that fit the data better."

To overcome these limitations an alternative method, NumART*2 (NUMerical Algorithm for Real-time T*2 mapping) that directly calculates T*2 by a linear combination of images obtained at three or more different echo times was developed. NumART*2, linear least-squares, and nonlinear regression techniques were applied to multiecho planar images of the human brain and to simulated data. Although NumART*2 may overestimate T*2, it yields comparable values to regression techniques in cortical and subcortical areas, with only moderate deviations for echo spacings between 18 and 40 ms. NumART*2, like linear regression, requires 2% of the computational time needed for nonlinear regression and compares favorably with linear regression due to its higher precision.

We apply the technique of Monte Carlo (MC) tests, see Dwass and Barnard, respectively (Ann. Math. Statist. 28 (1957) 181; J.R. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 25 (1963) 294) to obtain exact tests based on standard LR and LM zero correlation tests. We also suggest a MC quasi-LR (QLR) test based on feasible generalized least squares (FGLS). We show that the latter statistics are pivotal under the null, which provides the justification for applying MC tests. Furthermore, we extend the exact independence test proposed by Harvey and Phillips (Bull. Econ. Res. 34 (2) (1982) 79) to the multi-equation framework. Specifically, we introduce several induced tests based on a set of simultaneous Harvey/Phillips-type tests and suggest a simulation-based solution to the associated combination problem. The properties of the proposed tests are studied in a Monte Carlo experiment which shows that standard asymptotic tests exhibit important size distortions, while MC tests achieve complete size control and display good power. Moreover, MC-QLR tests performed best in terms of power, a result of interest from the point of view of simulation-based tests. The power of the MC induced tests improves appreciably in comparison to standard Bonferroni tests and in certain cases outperform the likelihood-based MC tests. The tests are applied to data used by Fischer (J. Monetary Econ. 32, 485) (1993) to analyze the macroeconomic determinants of growth. © 2002 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved."

Methods: Longitudinal visual field data (Full-Threshold Program 30-2 test point pattern) were simulated using a computer model of glaucomatous visual field progression. This approach permitted construction of a ""gold standard"" because matching visual field data without variability could be generated and analyzed. Four clustered progressive defects were produced, consisting of 2, 3, 9, and 18 locations, respectively, each with progression rates of -1 and -2.5 dB/y. Pointwise linear regression was used to identify progressive test locations (criterion for progression of statistically significant slope of ≤-1 dB/y, P < .05). Each visual field series was analyzed after the following 3 procedures: (1) no filtering (unprocessed data), (2) Gaussian spatial possessing (3 × 3 grid), and (3) temporal processing (2 field moving average). The effect of spatial and temporal processing on PLR discriminatory power for progression detection was quantified by comparison with the gold standard. Results: Spatial processing reduced PLR sensitivity to levels below that achieved for analysis of unprocessed data for small progressive defects (≤9 locations) or at the low true progression rate (-1 dB/y). Under these conditions, spatial processing caused small PLR specificity improvement. Spatial processing only improved PLR sensitivity above unprocessed levels when progressive defects were large and changing rapidly (progression rate of -2.5 dB/y). Temporal processing gave consistent PLR improvement in sensitivity for all defect sizes and true progression rates. Pointwise linear regression sensitivity gain provided by temporal processing allowed progression to be detected 2 to 3 visual fields earlier than for analysis of raw data. Specificity dropped slightly as a result of temporal processing but remained at 89% or above for all conditions studied. Conclusions: Gaussian spatial processing reduces PLR discriminatory power with low true progression rates or small progressive defect sizes and, therefore, is of limited use for detection of progressive visual field loss. Temporal processing improves the sensitivity of PLR and reduces the number of tests required to detect progressive loss with minimal loss of specificity. Clinical Relevance: Image processing techniques can be applied to threshold visual field data to enhance sensitivity or specificity of PLR for the determination of progressive change. This investigation demonstrates that temporal processing may assist with the detection of significant progressive visual field loss with fewer test results than unprocessed data."

Therefore, information on correlated conformation traits scored on daughters during their first lactation may be essential for the evaluation of young bulls with mostly censored daughters. Currently available programs for genetic evaluation based on survival analysis cannot combine indirect information on conformation traits with direct information on herd life, nor can they estimate genetic covariances between herd life and conformation traits. In this study, an alternative approach has been developed and tested using data on Swiss Simmental and Red & White cattle. Genetic covariances were approximated using breeding values for herd life from a survival analysis and BLUP breeding values for 26 linear conformation traits from a separate multivariate analysis. An index combining direct breeding values for herd life and indirect breeding values obtained from conformation traits was constructed. The relative weighting of both information sources varied depending on the amount of available information. The maximum reliability based only on conformation traits was 0.64. Except for old bulls with >100 uncensored daughters, the combined reliability was always higher than the direct reliability from survival analysis."

A previous analysis of nucleus prepositus hypoglossi (nph) lesions in monkeys found that the integration time constant for maintaining fixations decreased, while that for the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) did not. On this basis, it was concluded that saccadic inputs are integrated by the nph, but that the vestibular inputs are integrated elsewhere. We re-analyze the data from which this conclusion was drawn by performing a linear regression of eye velocity on eye position and head velocity to derive the time constant and velocity bias of an imperfect oculomotor neural integrator. The velocity-position regression procedure reveals that the integration time constants for both VOR and saccades decrease in tandem with consecutive nph lesions, consistent with the hypothesis of a single common integrator. The previous evaluation of the integrator time constant relied upon fitting methods that are prone to error in the presence of velocity bias and saccades. The algorithm used to evaluate imperfect fixations in the dark did not account for the nonzero null position of the eyes associated with velocity bias. The phase-shift analysis used in evaluating the response to sinusoidal vestibular input neglects the effect of saccadic resets of eye position on intersaccadic eye velocity, resulting in gross underestimates of the imperfections in integration during VOR. The linear regression method presented here is valid for both fixation and low head velocity VOR data and is easy to implement."

The model uses the best-track data set of historical hurricane positions and intensities, together with climate variables, to determine local space-time coefficients of a right-truncated Poisson process. The truncated Poisson space-time autoregressive (TPSTAR) model is motivated by first examining a time-series model for the entire domain. Then a Poisson generalized linear model is considered that uses grid boxes within the domain and adds offset factors for latitude and longitude. A natural extension is then made that includes instantaneous local and autoregressive coupling between the grids. A final version of the model is found by backward selection of the predictors based on values of Bayesian and Akiake information criteria. The final model has five nearest neighbours and statistically significant couplings. Hindcasts are performed on the hurricane seasons from 1994 to 1997. Results show that, on average, model forecast probabilities are larger in regions in which hurricanes occurred. Quantitative skill assessment indicates some useful skill above climatology - currently the default leading candidate. The TPSTAR model could be a valuable guidance product when issuing seasonal hurricane forecasts. Copyright © 2002 Royal Meteorological Society."

Methods: Representative asphalt paving and mixing operations were monitored in Norway in 1991-92 for exposures to bitumen fume, organic vapor, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and vehicle exhaust (NO2, CO). Linear regression was used to evaluate introduced control measures. Results: A total of 320 samples of airborne organic matter were gathered (279 from paving). Median personal bitumen fume measurements ranged from 0.03 to 0.15 mg/m3 and were similar in paving and asphalt mixing. According to principal component analysis, there were three independent sets of PAHs: (i) PAHs lighter than 228 g/mol; (ii) 4- to 6-ring PAHs nondetectable in 80-90% of samples; and (iii) naphthalene. Some NO2 (1/49) and CO (12/58) concentrations near paving equipment exceeded 15 min exposure limits, 2 and 25 p.p.m., respectively. Changing sampling methods midway through the study had a significant impact on the measured bitumen fume and organic vapor levels. For pavers, lower application temperatures reduced organic vapor, but not bitumen fume, exposures. Retrofitting a paving machine produced at least a 5-fold reduction in exposure to airborne organic matter. Work in tunnels increased PAH exposures, but general ventilation partially counteracted this effect. Conclusions: The observed exposure levels indicate that some potentially hazardous exposures may have occurred during paving in Norway. Bitumen fume, organic vapor and PAH exposures can be reduced using appropriate engineering control measures."

Protein recovered from hydroxyapatite chromatography was approx. 90% pure UCP2, as judged by Coomassie Blue and silver staining of polyacrylamide gels. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer, N-methylanthraniloyl-tagged purine nucleoside di- and tri-phosphates exhibited enhanced fluorescence with purified UCP2. Dissociation constants determined by least-squares non-linear regression indicated that the affinity of UCP2 for these fiuorescently tagged nucleotides was 3-5 μM or perhaps an order of magnitude stronger, depending on the model used. Competition experiments with [8-14C]ATP demonstrated that UCP2 binds unmodified purine and pyrimidine nucleoside triphosphates with 2-5 μM affinity.

Only home care workers who had LBP at the start of the study or who had experienced at least two episodes of LBP in the 12 months prior to the study could apply for participation. The study consisted of two phases. In phase I (the first week of the study), workers used the lumbar support each working day. In phase II (the following 6 months), subjects were instructed to use the lumbar support only on those working days when they experienced LBP. Weekly questionnaires were used to measure compliance; monthly questionnaires were used to measure the benefit experienced. Fifty-nine workers participated in the study. Overall, they scored their perceived benefit from the lumbar support as 7 on a scale of 0-10, and 61-81% of the workers were compliant. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the best predictor for experienced benefit is the degree of confidence in expected pain reduction due to the lumbar support, measured after phase I (R2 = 0.70). Multiple logistic analysis showed that the best predictor for compliance is the extent to which subjects consider they can influence their own health status (R2 = 0.49). Because both the benefit experienced and the compliance rate were substantial, the use of lumbar supports by home care workers with LBP seems feasible. However, we cannot recommend extensive use of lumbar supports in home care workers with LBP based solely on the results of the present study.

Furthermore, triacylglycerol concentrations are generally higher in whites than in blacks, and the relation of obesity to triacylglycerol concentrations may be stronger in whites. However, there is little information on the relation of obesity to the metabolically distinct subclasses of VLDL in children. Objective: The objective was to examine possible differences between blacks (n = 367) and whites (n = 549) in mean concentrations of triacylglycerols, in mean concentrations of small and large VLDL, and in the relation of waist circumference to concentrations of triacylglycerol and VLDL subclasses. Design: We measured VLDL subclass concentrations and assessed the relation of various obesity indexes to triacylglycerols in a cross-sectional study of 10- to 17-y-olds. Results: The mean triacylglycerol concentration was 0.3 mmol/L (25 mg/dL) higher in white than in black children, primarily because of a 0.2-mmol/L (140%) difference in mean concentrations of large VLDL. In contrast, the mean concentrations of small VLDL differed by only 0.05 mmol/L (29%). In addition, the relations of waist girth to concentrations of triacylglycerol and large VLDL were 2- to 6-fold stronger among white children than among black children. Although white children had higher concentrations of large VLDL than did black children, this difference increased from 0.1 to 0.4 mmol/L across quintiles of waist circumference. Waist circumference was not significantly related to concentrations of small VLDL. Conclusion: These contrasting associations with obesity, which differ between white and black children, suggest that information on VLDL subclasses could provide additional information on the risk of obesity-related ischemic heart disease."

Methods: Visual fields of patients with confirmed or suspected glaucoma were analyzed (n = 255). One eye per patient was included. Patients were examined using the 32 program of the Octopus 1-2-3. Linear regression analysis among each of the locations and the rest of the points of the visual field was performed, and the correlation coefficient was calculated. The degree of correlation was categorized as high (r2 > 0.66), moderate (0.66 ≥ r2 > 0.33), or low (r2 ≤ 0.33). The standard error of threshold estimation was calculated. Results: Most locations of the visual field had high and moderate correlations with neighboring points and with distant locations corresponding to the same nerve fiber bundle. Locations of the visual field had low correlations with those of the opposite hemifield, with the exception of locations temporal to the blind spot. The standard error of threshold estimation increased from 0.6 to 0.9 dB with an r2 reduction of 0.1. Conclusion: Locations of the visual field have highest interpoint correlation with neighboring points and with distant points in areas corresponding to the distribution of the retinal nerve fiber layer. The quantification of interpoint correlations may be useful in the design and interpretation of visual field tests in patients with glaucoma."

Methods: A longitudinal study of cervical dimensions obtained by translabial sonography at 24, 28, 30, 32, and 34 weeks' gestation in 144 women was conducted. The gestational age at labor was recorded and women were defined as having preterm labor or term labor according to whether there was onset of true labor pain before or after 37 completed weeks, respectively. Cervical changes over time were analyzed by repeated ANOVA. The associations between cervical dimensions and gestational age, parity and prepregnancy body mass index were calculated by multiple linear regression analysis. Results: Cervical length decreased whereas cervical width increased as gestational age advanced. Cervical length and width in women with term labor, but only cervical length in women with preterm labor, changed significantly throughout the period of 24-34 weeks' gestation (P < 0.01). The cervix was significantly longer in parous women and in women with a body mass index of more than 26 kg/m2, but was shorter in women of advanced gestational age. The cervix was significantly wider in parous women and in those of advanced gestational age. Weekly crude rate, adjusted for parity and prepregnancy body mass index, of both cervical length shortening and cervical width widening was 0.4 mm in women with term labor. Women with preterm labor had cervical shortening of 0.5 mm per week. Conclusions: Gestational age, parity and prepregnancy body mass index are significantly associated with the dynamic changes of cervical length and width in Thai women. These factors should be considered when assessing normal values of cervical dimensions and for predicting the risk of preterm delivery."

Previous studies have suggested that milk-borne IGF-1 may be absorbed intact from the gastrointestinal tract of the suckling but the mechanism responsible for such transport is not well documented. The present study was designed to investigate in an in vivo suckling rat model whether or not intestinal absorption of IGF-1 is a saturable phenomenon. Methods: Suckling rats (10-12 days postnatal age) were studied under anesthesia. A jejunal loop from each rat pup was isolated and injected intraluminally with 1-2 x 105 cpm of rh125I-IGF-I. Injections were performed in paired littermates either with or without a preceding injection of unlabeled IGF-I of 20, 500, or 1000 ng/ml concentration. After flushing, the loops and livers were homogenized and counted in a gamma counter. In addition, homogenates of jejunum and liver were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and the precipitates also counted. In selected instances (jejunum), acid gel chromatography of homogenates was also performed. Results: Retention of radioactivity was observed in all jejunal specimens, but the pre-incubation of jejunal loops with unlabeled IGF-1 was associated with a biphasic response, i.e. at low dose (20 ng/ml) pre-incubation limited retention of radioactivity, but at a high dose (1000 ng/ml), retention was enhanced (P < 0.05). Linear regression analysis confirmed this inverse relationship. Liver radioactivity followed a similar pattern. Between 40 and 49% of the radioactivity in jejunal and liver homogenates was TCA precipitable. Chromatography of jejunal homogenates showed that approximately 40% of cpm migrated in a position identical with that of intact IGF-1. Conclusions: The intestinal uptake of IGF-1 in the suckling is nonsaturable, confirming previous in vitro studies and suggesting that a nonreceptor-dependent method of transepithelial transport is important in this process. © 2002 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc."

Studies have suggested that lead stored in bone may adversely affect bone mineral metabolism and blood lead (PbB) levels. However, the relationship between PbB levels and bone loss attributed to periodontal disease has never been reported. In this study we examined the relationship between clinical parameters that characterize bone loss due to periodontal disease and PbB levels in the U.S. population. We used data from the Third National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES III), 1988-1994, for the analyses. A total of 10,033 participants 20-69 years of age who completed a periodontal examination and had whole blood tested for lead were examined. Four types of periodontal disease measures were used to indicate oral bone loss: periodontal pocket depth, attachment loss extent, attachment loss severity, and the presence of dental furcations. We found that dental furcations were the best periodontal bone loss indicator for PbB levels (p = 0.005) in a multivariate linear regression model adjusting for sex, age, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, poverty status, smoking, and age of home. Furthermore, after additional modeling, we found a smoking and dental furcation interaction (p = 0.034). Subsequent stratified analyses indicated that current and past smoking is an effect modifier for dental furcations on PbB levels. These findings indicate that increased PbB levels may be associated with advanced periodontal bone loss, particularly among people with a history of smoking."

Nine subjects (2 females) participated in this study (25 ± 2 years, ± S.E.M.). EMG was obtained from the vastus lateralis and medialis and analysed in the time (root mean square, RMS) and frequency (median power frequency, MDPF) domain. Results for each muscle were averaged to provide an overall response and expressed relative to a maximal voluntary contraction (%MVC). Δ VO2/ΔWR was calculated for exercise below (S1) and above (S2) the lactate threshold (LT) using linear regression. The increase in RMS relative to the increase in WR for exercise below the LT (ΔRMS/ΔWR-S1) was determined using linear regression. Due to non-linearities in RMS above the LT, ΔRMS/ΔWR-S2 is reported as the difference in RMS (ΔRMS) and the difference in WR (ΔWR) at end-exercise and the LT. SR was associated with a higher (P < 0.05) ΔVO2/ΔWR (S1, 9.3 ± 0.3 ml min-1 W-1; S2, 12.5 ± 0.6 ml min-1 W-1) than FR (S1, 8.5 ± 0.4 ml min-1 W-1; S2, 7.9 ± 0.4 ml min-1 W-1) but a similar ΔRMS/ΔWR-S1 (SR, 0.11 ± 0.01% W-1; FR, 0.10 ± 0.01% W-1). ExVO2 was greater (P < 0.05) in SR (3.6 ± 0.7 l) than FR (-0.7 ± 0.4 l) but was not associated with a difference in either ΔRMS/ΔWR-S2 (SR, 0.14 ± 0.01% W-1; FR, 15 ± 0.02% W-1) or MDPF (SR, 2.6 ± 5.9%; FR, - 15.4 ± 4.5%). The close matching between power output and RMS during SR and FR suggests that the ExVO2 of heavy exercise is not associated with the recruitment of additional motor units since ExVO2 was observed during SR only. Compared to the progressive decrease in MDPF observed during FR, the MDPF remained relatively constant during SR suggesting that either (i) there was no appreciable recruitment of the less efficient type II muscle fibres, at least in addition to those recruited initially at the onset of exercise, or (ii) the decrease in MDPF associated with fatigue was offset by the addition of a higher frequency of type II fibres recruited to replace the fatigued motor units."

Here the relative loss is the total loss of the on-line algorithm in all trials minus the total loss of the best comparator that is chosen off-line. However, for many applications instantaneous loss bounds are more interesting where the learner first sees a batch of examples and then uses these examples to make a prediction on a new instance. We show relative expected instantaneous loss bounds for the case when the examples are i.i.d. with an unknown distribution. We bound the expected loss of the algorithm on the last example minus the expected loss of the best comparator on a random example. In particular, we study linear regression and density estimation problems and show how the leave-one-out loss can be used to prove instantaneous loss bounds for these cases. For linear regression we use an algorithm that is similar to a new on-line learning algorithm developed by Vovk. Recently a large number of relative total loss bounds have been shown that have the form O(ln T), where T is the number of trials/examples. Standard conversions of on-line algorithms to batch algorithms result in relative expected instantaneous loss bounds of the form O(ln T/T). Our methods lead to O(l/T) upper bounds. In many cases we give tight lower bounds. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA)."

Design: The frequency of separate eating events (with the exclusion of lunch and dinner) and their sugars and starch content were assessed on the basis of diaries collected for seven consecutive days. The total number of decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) was assessed through clinical examination. The interrelation between DMFT and frequency of eating events was analysed through Pearson correlation coefficient and stepwise forward linear regression analysis. Setting: Italy. Subjects: One hundred and ninety-three students (males and females, mean age 16 years) of a secondary school. Results: Individual DMFT varied between 0 (24% of subjects) and 12, with a mean of 3. Once lunch and dinner were excluded, the mean number of separate eating events was 2.9. A statistically significant relationship was found between DMFT and eating frequency thus defined. Correlations were calculated considering only eating events containing a proportion of sugars or starch higher than different cut-off levels. In a stepwise multiple regression model for DMFT, the frequency of 'high sugars and high starch events' accounted for 8% of the DMFT variance. Overall frequency of separate eating events defined according to their content of both sugars and starch accounted for 18% of the DMFT variance. A stronger correlation was found among males only. Conclusions: The precise characterisation of eating events in terms of their sugars and starch content allows us to explain a consistent percentage of the variability in DMFT. © 2002 CABI."

Seven academic centres studied 302 patients, using desflurane, enflurane, halothane, or isoflurane using circle-systems and Dräger Julian anaesthetic machines, with fresh gas flows (VF) of 3, 1, and 0.5 litre min-1. Volatile agent partial pressures in the breathing system were recorded and agent consumptions measured by weighing. Results. At these flows, desflurane consumption depended on VF. In contrast, halothane consumption was not influenced by VF. Isoflurane and enflurane showed differences in consumption between flows of 0.5 and 3 litre min-1. Stepwise linear regression suggested that besides VF, other factors influenced consumption of the more soluble agents (sex, age, weight, height, altitude, and temperature). The partial pressure ratios were independent of VF for desflurane (end-tidal to fresh gas=0.8), but the ratios of the more soluble agents varied with VF (end-tidal to fresh gas=0.3-0.7). Conclusions. At VF that involves significant re-breathing, consumption of soluble agents depends only partially on VF. These results can be explained using Mapleson's hydraulic analogue model."

The grades of gastritis and density of H. pylori colonization were scored separately using the updated Sydney system for antral and body mucosa. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the quantitative detection in serum of IgG antibodies to H. pylori was performed. Of the 170 dyspeptic patients, 105 (62%) had H. pylori infection. There was no difference in antibody levels among endoscopic findings of normal mucosa, chronic gastritis, and duodenal ulcer. On multivariate linear regression analysis, the status of H. pylori infection, mononuclear cell infiltration of body mucosa, and age correlated with antibody levels. The negative predictive value for antibody levels of <30 U/ml is 94%, and the positive predictive value of antibody levels of >70 U/ml is 98%. We conclude that serum antibody levels do not predict the severity of gastroduodenal diseases or the density of H. pylori colonization in H. pylori-infected dyspeptic patients. Higher levels are associated with the presence of H. pylori infection, the chronic gastritis score of the corpus, and older age. Setting a gray zone is necessary for ELISA, since the accuracy in this zone does not allow a precise determination of H. pylori status."

The basic idea is to think of the choice, in our case hours of labor supply, as being a function of the entire budget set. Then we can do nonparametric regression where the variable in the regression is the budget set. We reduce the dimensionality of this problem by exploiting structure implied by utility maximization with piecewise linear convex budget sets. This structure leads to estimators where the number of segments can differ across observations and does not affect accuracy. We give consistency and asymptotic normality results for these estimators. The usefulness of the estimator is demonstrated in an empirical example, where we find it has a large impact on estimated effects of the Swedish tax reform."

Results: Non-responders were characterized by a higher degree of pre-treatment hypochondriasis, more somatization symptoms and general psychopathology (SCL-90R), more dysfunctional cognitions related to bodily functioning, higher levels of psychosocial impairments, and more utilization of the health care system as indicated by the number of hospital days and costs for inpatient treatments and medication.

Also, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) may be associated with the magnitude of CFR in relation to its modulating action on cardiac and endothelial function. Methods: A total of 44 newly diagnosed, untreated hypertensive patients, who were free of diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease, underwent M-mode analysis, second-harmonic Doppler echocardiographic assessment of CFR (dipyridamole infusion 0.56 mg/kg intravenously in four patients), determination of circulating free IGF-1, and insulin resistance. Based on CFR levels, hypertensive subjects were divided into two groups: 18 with normal CFR (≥2) and 26 with impaired CFR (<2). Results: Patients with normal CFR had lower diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and LV mass index but higher free circulating IGF-1 than patients with reduced CFR (P < .001). Insulin resistance was not significantly different between the two groups. In a first multilinear regression analysis that included demographic and echocardiographic variables, insulin resistance was independently associated with CFR (standardized β coefficient = -0.31, P < .05) in the overall population. However, in a subsequent model which included also IGF-1, the relationship between insulin resistance and CFR disappeared, whereas IGF-1 was the main independent determinant of CFR (β = 0.51, P < .0002). Conclusions: Free IGF-1 circulating levels are independently associated with CFR in hypertensive individuals free of overt coronary artery disease. A possible beneficial effect exerted by IGF-1 on coronary blood flow may be supposed in arterial hypertension. © 2002 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd."

In medical imaging, physicians often estimate a parameter of interest (eg, cardiac ejection fraction) for a patient to assist in establishing a diagnosis. Many different estimation methods may exist, but rarely can one be considered a gold standard. Therefore, evaluation and comparison of different estimation methods are difficult. The purpose of this study was to examine a method of evaluating different estimation methods without use of a gold standard. Materials and Methods. This method is equivalent to fitting regression lines without the x axis. To use this method, multiple estimates of the clinical parameter of interest for each patient of a given population were needed. The authors assumed the statistical distribution for the true values of the clinical parameter of interest was a member of a given family of parameterized distributions. Furthermore, they assumed a statistical model relating the clinical parameter to the estimates of its value. Using these assumptions and observed data, they estimated the model parameters and the parameters characterizing the distribution of the clinical parameter. Results. The authors applied the method to simulated cardiac ejection fraction data with varying numbers of patients, numbers of modalities, and levels of noise. They also tested the method on both linear and nonlinear models and characterized the performance of this method compared to that of conventional regression analysis by using x-axis information. Results indicate that the method follows trends similar to that of conventional regression analysis as patients and noise vary, although conventional regression analysis outperforms the method presented because it uses the gold standard which the authors assume is unavailable. Conclusion. The method accurately estimates model parameters. These estimates can be used to rank the systems for a given estimation task. © AUR, 2002."

Methods: A retrospective incident cohort study was conducted to determine if pre-dialysis clinic attendance was a predictor of better QOL scores measured within the first six months of hemodialysis (HD) initiation. Inclusion criteria were HD initiation from January 1 1998 to January 1 2000, diagnosis of chronic renal failure, and completion of the QOL questionnaire within six months of HD initiation. Patients receiving HD for less than four weeks were excluded. An incident cohort of 120 dialysis patients was identified, including 74 patients who attended at least one pre-dialysis clinic and 46 patients who did not. QOL was measured using the SF 36-Item Health Survey. Independent variables included age, sex, diabetes, pre-dialysis clinic attendance and length of attendance, history of ischemic heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, heart failure, malignancy, and chronic lung disease, residual creatinine clearance at dialysis initiation, and kt/v, albumin and hemoglobin at the time of QOL assessment. Bivariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were used to identify predictors of QOL scores. Results: Multivariate analysis suggested that pre-dialysis clinic attendance was an independent predictor of higher QOL scores in four of eight health domains (physical function, p < 0.01; emotional role limitation, p = 0.01; social function, p = 0.01; and general health, p = 0.03), even after statistical adjustment for age, sex, residual renal function, kt/v, albumin, and co-morbid disease. Pre-dialysis clinic attendance was also an independent predictor of the physical component summary score (p = 0.03). Conclusions: We conclude that pre-dialysis clinic attendance favourably influences patient-perceived quality of life within six months of dialysis initiation."

Results: Marked regional differences were found in both groups. Total labelling index (LI) and proliferative zone size in both normal (8.65±0.34 vs 7.2±0.45, 27.74±1.07 vs 16.75±1.45) and DMH groups (13.13±0.46 vs 11.55±0.45, 39.60±1.32 vs 35.52±1.58) were significantly higher in distal than in proximal colon (P<0.05), although the number of cells per proximal crypt was greater (31.45±0.20 vs 34.45±0.39, 42.68±0.53 vs. 49.09±0.65, P<0.0001).

Inconclusive results have been reported in patients with frontotemporal degeneration which prompted this study of the apoE polymorphism in a German sample with frontotemporal degeneration. Methods: The frequencies of the ε2 and ε4 alleles and the effect of these alleles on the age at onset in 52 patients with frontotemporal degeneration who underwent a thorough diagnostic examination and in 182 cognitively healthy age matched controls were assessed. Genotype comparisons between the groups were performed using multiple logistic regression analysis. Ages at onset according to the apoE genotype were compared by linear regression analysis. Results: In patients with frontotemporal degeneration apoE ε2 and ε4 allele frequencies were 9.6% each, whereas the corresponding frequencies in controls were 9.6% and 9.9%, respectively. There was no significant difference in either ε2 or ε4 allele frequency between the groups. Age at onset was highest in patients with the ε2/ε3 genotype (61.3 years) followed by patients with the ε3/ε3 (58.3 years) and was lowest in patients with the ε3/ε4 genotype (56.4 years) but the differences failed to reach statistical significance.

The present study aimed to determine more precisely the phenylalanine requirements in patients with the disease by use of indicator amino acid oxidation, with L-[1-13C] lysine as the indicator. Breath 13CO2 production (F13CO2) was used as the end point. Finger-prick blood samples were also collected for measurement of phenylalanine to relate phenylalanine intake to blood phenylalanine levels. The mean phenylalanine requirement, estimated using a two-phase linear regression crossover analysis, was 14 mg·kg-1·day-1, and the safe population intake (upper 95% confidence interval of the mean) was found to be 19.5 mg·kg-1·day-1. A balance between phenylalanine intake and the difference between fed and fasted blood phenylalanine concentration was observed at an intake of 20 mg·kg-1·day-1. The similarity between these two values (19.5 and 20 mg·kg-1·day-1) suggests that the maximal phenylalanine intake for children with PKU should be no higher than 20 mg·kg-1·day-1."

Design: A cross-sectional study. Methods: Average total daily dietary intakes of vitamin C, β-carotene, α-tocopherol, selenium, and zinc from foods and nutritional supplements were estimated in noninstitutionalized individuals using the dietary history method. Plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations were measured by high-performance-liquidchromatography (HPLC) whereas peripheral blood mononuclear cell glutathione (PBMC GSH) concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically by an enzymatic recycling assay. Data were analyzed in multiple linear regression models to investigate these relationships. Results: Regression analysis revealed an inverse relationship between selenium intake and plasma MDA in a model that included the five dietary antioxidants (R2 = 0.25; p < .02) and with selenium only (R2 = 0.19; p < .01). Both models were adjusted for gender, smoking status, and HIV seropositivity. Antioxidant intake was not associated with PBMC GSH (R2 = 0.12, p = .36). In univariate analyses, oxidative stress did not significantly differ between clinically stable HIV-positive and healthy HIVnegative study subjects. Conclusions: This is the first study to characterize the relationship between dietary antioxidant intake from food and supplements with oxidative stress. The results suggested dietary selenium intake was strongly and inversely associated with plasma MDA, but dietary antioxidant intakes were not related to PBMC GSH. This study also provides evidence that HIV infection was not specifically associated with oxidative stress among clinically stable individuals."

Methods: Acoustic rhinometry was performed on 161 woodworkers and 19 controls. For each person, four measuring rounds were performed: before work, after 4 hours of work, and after 7 hours of work before and after decongestion. Before the first and third measuring round, each person rated the current feeling of nasal obstruction in the left and right nostril separately, using a visual analogue scale. Personal passive dust measurements were performed on 140 woodworkers. Results: The mean (SD) of equivalent inhalable dust was relatively low, 1.17 (0.62) mg/m3, range 0.17-3.44 mg/m3. The exposure was divided into four levels: controls, low exposure, medium exposure, and high exposure. For the two highest concentrations of exposure, a significant increase in congestion - decreased nasal cavity volume and cross sectional areas - was found after 4 and 7 hours of work, compared with before work. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed positive correlations between concentration of dust and change in mucosal swelling. A significant increase in self rated nasal obstruction was found after work compared with before work for the two highest exposure groups. No correlation between objective nasal variables and self rated nasal obstruction was found. Conclusion: Exposure to wood dust was related in a dose dependent manner to acute nasal obstruction measured by acoustic rhinometry and self reported obstruction, but no correlation was found between measured and self reported obstruction."

Exposure level included the current exposure concentration, past cumulative exposure, and the maximum exposure level in the past. Methods: Colour vision was examined by the Lanthony desaturated panel D-15 test for 76 subjects exposed to styrene in a fibreglass reinforced plastics boat plant (as an exposed group) and 102 non-exposed subjects (as a control group). The current exposure level was expressed by the concentration of atmospheric styrene and end shift urinary mandelic acid (MA) and phenylglyoxylic acid (PGA) levels. The individual cumulative exposure index (CEI) was calculated, based on the exposure frequency and urinary MA concentrations measured for the past eight years. Results: The Colour Confusion Index (CCl) of the exposed group showed a significant difference from the age matched controls. However, only a slight significant relation was found between CCl and the concentration of urinary MA plus PGA. In this study, the exposed group was further divided into two subgroups (as sub-MA+PGA groups) by the median of urinary MA plus PGA of each subject. The dividing line between the subgroups was 0.24 g/g creatinine, which was equivalent to an atmospheric concentration of styrene of about 10 ppm. The CCl values of both the sub-MA+PGA groups were significantly higher than that of the control group. The relation between CCl value and the maximum exposure concentration in the past eight years was examined. It was found that the CCl values of the group with the maximum exposure concentration of styrene over 50 ppm were significantly higher than that of the other groups. Conclusions: Exposure to styrene would impair colour vision even if the exposure concentration was lower than 10 ppm. Furthermore, if the maximum concentration of styrene exposure transiently exceeded 50 ppm in the past, the styrene related damage might remain. Thus, the safe limit of exposure to styrene and the relation between exposure to styrene and the degree of damage to ocular structure, retina, optic nerve, and brain need to be re-examined."

For all selected workers, urine samples were collected on the first day pre-shift, first day post-shift and fifth day post-shift, and their urinary 1-hydroxylpyrene levels (1-OHP) were determined (denoted as BM1pre, BM1post and BM5post, respectively). Personal respiratory exposures, including both inhalable particle-bound PAHs (Cinh) and gaseous PAHs (Cgas), together with dermal exposure to particle-bound PAHs (Cskin) were measured. Personal background information, including age, sex and smoking habit, was carefully registered. Pyrene exposure was statistically significantly correlated with exposure to PAHs and carcinogenic PAHs. Multiple linear regression analysis results showed that the BM1post values could not be explained by workers' exposures. For BM5post in packaging workers, both the regression model (R2 = 0.73) and the regression coefficients for Cgas, Cinh and Cskin were statistically significant (P < 0.05). For pelletizing workers, the R2 value was higher but was not statistically significant because of the smaller number of workers. The resultant regression coefficients for 'sex', 'smoking habit' and 'age' were statistically insignificant (P ≫ 0.05), which could be because these variables made relatively small contributions to BM5post.

Animals- 10 dogs (7 males, 3 females). Procedure-Cardiac output (CO) was determined in anesthetized dogs by measuring LiDCO and thermodilution cardiac output (TDCO). The effect of the serum lithium concentration on LiDCO was assessed by observing the agreement between TDCO and LiDCO at various serum lithium concentrations. Also, cumulative lithium chloride dosage was compared with the corresponding serum lithium concentrations. Results-44 paired observations were used. The linear regression analysis for the effect of the serum lithium concentration on the agreement between TDCO and LiDCO revealed a slope of -1.530 (95% confidence interval [CI], -2.388 to -0.671) and a y-intercept of 0.011 (r2 = 0.235). The linear regression analysis for the effect of the cumulative lithium chloride dosage on the serum lithium concentration revealed a slope of 2.291 (95% Cl, 2.153 to 2.429) and a y-intercept of 0.008 (r2 = 0.969). Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-The LiDCO measurement increased slightly as the serum lithium concentration increased. This error was not clinically relevant and was minimal at a serum lithium concentration of 0.1 mmol/L and modest at a concentration of 0.4 mmol/L. The serum lithium concentration can be reliably predicted from the cumulative lithium dosage if lithium chloride is administered often within a short period."

Two major parts dominate our histogram analysis; 1) Classification of MTR histograms into control and MS subgroups; 2) Correlation with current disability, as measured by the EDSS scale (a measure of disease severity). Two data reduction schemes are used to reduce the complexity of the analysis: linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and principal component analysis (PCA). LDA is better for the classification of MTR histograms as it takes into account the between-class variation. By using LDA, the space of MTR histograms is transformed to the optimal discriminant space for a nearest mean classifier. In contrast, PCA is useful for correlation with current disability as it takes into account the variation within each subgroup in its process. A multiple regression analysis is used to evaluate the multiple correlation of those principal components with the degree of disability in MS. This is the first application of such classification and correlation techniques to magnetic resonance imaging histogram data. Our MTR histogram analysis approach give improved classification success and improved correlation compared with methods that use traditional histogram features such as peak height and peak location."

Difficulties are most apparent in brain regions having low blood flow and/or high enzyme or receptor concentration and are exacerbated with noisy data. This is especially true when minimal doses of radiotracer are administered. A comparison was recently reported of the irreversible monoamine oxidase A (MAO A) radiotracers [11C]clorgyline (CLG) and deuterium-substituted [11C]clorgyline (CLG-D) in the human brain using region of interest (ROI) analysis in which the authors observed an unexpected loss of image contrast with CLG-D compared with CLG. In order to more fully investigate patterns of binding of these irreversibly binding radiotracers, a strategy was devised to reduce noise in the generation of parametric images of the model term related to enzyme or receptor concentration. The generalized linear least squares (GLLS) method of Feng et al. (1995), a rapid linear method that is unbiased, was used for image-wide parameter estimation. Since GLLS can fail in the presence of large amounts of noise, local voxels were grouped within the image to increase the signal, and the GLLS method was combined with the standard nonlinear estimation methods when necessary. Voxels were grouped together depending on their proximity and whether they fell within a specified range of the time-integrated image. It was assumed that voxels meeting both criteria are functionally related. Simulations reflecting varying enzyme concentrations were performed to assess precision and accuracy of parameter estimates in the presence of varying amounts of noise. Using this approach, images were generated of the combination parameter λk3 (λ = K1/k2, where K1 and k2 are plasma-to-tissue and tissue-to-plasma transport constants, respectively) that is related to enzyme concentration as well as images of the transport constant K1 for individual subjects. Reasonably high-quality images of both K1 and λk3 were obtained for CLG and CLG-D for individual subjects even with low injected doses averaging 6 mCi. While there were no differences in the K1 images, the λk3 images revealed the loss of contrast previously reported for CLG-D using the ROI analysis. This method should be generalizable to other tracers and should facilitate the analysis of group differences."

As the cost of acute care in hospitals increases, there is an increasing need to find alternative means of providing acute care. Hospital in the home (HITH) has developed in response to this challenge. Current evidence is conflicting as to whether HITH provides cost savings compared with in-hospital care (IHC). The heterogeneous nature of HITH and the clinical complexity of patients is the greatest obstacle to making valid comparisons between the two modes of care. Objective. To compare costs and outcomes of HITH to IHC in hospitals in Victoria, Australia. Data sources/study setting. Hospital morbidity data and medical records from Victoria, Australia. Study design. A costing study of 924 randomly selected episodes of HITH care, individually matched to 924 comparable IHC episodes. Methods. Unadjusted total episode costs (TEC) and averaged daily costs for HITH and IHC were calculated. Mortality and length of stay (LOS) were compared for HITH and IHC episodes. Simple linear and multiple regression were used to analyse costing data, while logistic regression was used to compare in-hospital mortality and LOS in HITH versus IHC episodes. Principal findings. The 1848 episodes of care in the sample represented a heterogeneous range of acute conditions in 31 Victorian hospitals. HITH consisted of two distinct subgroups: pure-HITH (total episode substitution) and mixed-HITH (partial episode substitution). The cost of episodes of acute care containing a HITH component were overall 9% less expensive than IHC (P=0.04), while pure-HITH was 38% cheaper than matched IHC (P<0.001). The variable HITH, along with LOS and chemotherapy, explained the 60% variation in TEC. The mean cost of pure-HITH episodes was 22% lower compared to mixed-HITH (P=0.004). The in-hospital mortality rate in HITH (3.8%) and IHC (5.2%) was not significantly different. Pure-HITH was associated with shorter LOS, while mixed HITH was strongly associated with longer LOS. Conclusion. In our study the adjusted cost of HITH was significantly cheaper than IHC, particularly as total episode substitution. The cost needs to be adjusted because many factors other than HITH or IHC can influence crude costs. There may be potential for wider use of HITH for appropriately selected patients."

Participants were recruited in a cross-sectional population-based survey, including cardiovascular risk factor measurements and evaluation of physical activity and diet intake in a Mediterranean population (n 1748). Multiple linear regression analysis, adjusted for several confounders, showed a direct association of saturated fatty acids (g and % total energy intake), dietary cholesterol intakes and serum triacylglycerol with smoking. An inverse association was observed for smoking and unsaturated fatty acids (% energy intake), vitamin C, α-tocopherol and β-carotene intakes, leisure-time physical activity and HDL-cholesterol. These associations were not observed for alcohol drinking. After adjusting for the confounders earlier mentioned, low dietary intakes of vitamin C and dietary fibre were more likely in heavy-smokers as compared with non-smokers (odds ratio 1.74 (95% CI 1.07, 2.73) and 1.94 (95% CI 1.29, 2.92) of low vitamin C (< 60 mg/d) and dietary fibre intakes (< 10 g/d) respectively). Alcohol consumption was directly associated with HDL-cholesterol and triacylglycerol, and attenuated the effects of smoking on HDL-cholesterol. These results suggest that the dietary intake of fibre and several antioxidant components of the Mediterranean diet is reduced in smokers, who also show an adverse lipid profile. However, the worst triacylglycerol levels are associated with the combination of heavy smoking and heavy alcohol drinking. Moderate alcohol consumption was not associated with an unhealthy diet pattern or adverse lipid profile. The health benefits of the Mediterranean diet appear to be strongly counteracted by smoking."

Our network-based model provides an effective and efficient reasoning procedure to perform prediction and decision making. Unlike many existing paradigms based on linear models, the attribute relationship in our framework is represented by nonlinear nonnegative multiregressions based on the Choquet integral. This kind of multiregression is able to model a rich set of nonlinear interactions directly. Our framework involves two layers. The outer layer is a network structure consisting of network elements as its components, while the inner layer is concerned with a particular network element modeled by Choquet integrals. We develop a fast double optimization algorithm (FDOA) for learning the multiregression coefficients of a single network element. Using this local learning component and multiregression-residual-cost evolutionary programming (MRCEP), we propose a global learning algorithm, called MRCEP-FDOA, for discovering the network structures and their elements from databases. We have conducted a series of experiments to assess the effectiveness of our algorithm and investigate the performance under different parameter combinations, as well as sizes of the training data sets.

Strong correlations for grain protein and NIR wavelengths were found at 1,116, 1,268, 2,040, 2,068, 2,188 and 2,300 nm. Multiple linear regression equations provided improved predicting power for barley and malt protein with a standard error of prediction of 0.15 and 0.17%, respectively, whereas partial least squares regression gave a standard error of prediction of 0.22 and 0.27% for barley and malt, respectively. The use of NIR becomes more pronounced in breeding programs as NIR is a rapid and non-destructive technique allowing the screening of early generation lines with limited grain quantities. Also, the spectral analysis of native components from resting grain components will assist in building calibrations that provide qualitative values rather than just ranking breeding lines."

Design: A prospective design. Subjects: 176 adults with type 1 (39%) or type 2 (61%) diabetes. Main measures: Demographic variables, HbA1c, number of diabetes complications, satisfaction with diabetes care, diabetes related distress, and fear of hypoglycaemia were assessed by self-report. In addition, satisfaction with diabetes care and evaluations about quality of the care were measured at 16 month follow up. Statistical analysis comprised principal component analyses, Cronbach's alpha, t tests, Pearson's correlation, and linear regression analyses. Results: Results in the literature were used to develop the 14 items of the Patients' Evaluation of the Quality of Diabetes Care (PEQD) scale, assessing the most important aspects of the quality of diabetes care as delivered by the specialist in internal medicine (internist) and the diabetes nurse specialist (DNS). Two principal components analyses (internist/DNS) both yielded one 14 item factor with a high internal consistency. Satisfaction with diabetes care, fewer diabetes related complications, fewer treatment related problems, and a low level of worries about hypoglycaemia were predictors of a more positive evaluation of diabetes care delivered by the internist. Sociodemographic variables were not related to the patients' evaluations of the quality of diabetes care. Conclusions: The PEQD comprises different aspects of quality of diabetes care and can be regarded as a suitable instrument for evaluating patients' judgements about the quality of their care."

For this purpose the circulation of intermediate and deep water masses is established on the basis of hydrographic sections from the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) and some pre-WOCE sections, using temperature, salinity, nutrients, and anthropogenic tracers. Multiple linear regression is applied to infer missing parameters in the bottle dataset. A linear box-inverse model is used for a set of closed boxes given by sections and continental boundaries. After performing a detailed analysis of water mass distribution. 11 layers are prescribed. Neutral density surfaces are selected as layer interfaces, thus improving the description of water mass distribution in the transition between the subtropical and subpolar latitudes. Constraints for the inverse model include integral meridional salt and phosphorus transports, overall salt and silica conservation, and transports from moored current meter observations. Inferred transport numbers for the mean meridional thermohaline overturning are given. Persistent zonal NADW transport bands are found in the western South Atlantic, in particular eastward flow of relatively new NADW between 20° and 25°S and westward flow of older NADW to the north of this latitude range. The axis of the eastward transport band corresponds to the core of property distributions in this region, suggesting Wüstian flow. Part of the eastward flow appears to cross the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at the Rio de Janeiro Fracture Zone. Results are compared qualitatively with deep float observations and results from general circulation models."

The primary purpose of the study was to estimate the temperature dependence of the intercostal tissue's attenuation coefficient so that accurate estimates of the in situ (at the pleural surface) acoustic pressure levels could be made for our ultrasound-induced lung hemorrhage studies. The attenuation coefficient of intercostal tissue for both species was independent of the temperature at the discrete frequencies of 3.1 MHz (-0.0076, 0.0065, and 0.016 dB/cm/°C for SD rats, LE rats, and York pigs, respectively) and 6.2 MHz (-0.015, 0.014, and 0.014 dB/cm/°C for SD rats, LE rats, and York pigs, respectively). However, the temperature-dependent regressions yielded a significant temperature dependency of the intercostal tissue attenuation coefficients in SD and LE rats (over the 3.1 to 9.6 MHz frequency range); there was no temperature dependency in York pigs (over the 3.1 to 8.6 MHz frequency range). There was no significant temperature dependency of the intercostal tissue propagation speed in SD rats; there was a temperature dependency in LE rats and York pigs (-0.59, -1.6, and -2.9 m/s/°C for SD rats, LE rats, and York pigs, respectively). Even though the attenuation coefficient's temperature dependency was significant from the linear regression functions, the differences were not very great (-0.040 to -0.13, 0.011 to 0.18, and 0.055 to 0.10 dB/cm/°C for SD rats, LE rats, and York pigs, respectively, over the data frequency range). These findings suggest that it is not necessary to determine the attenuation coefficient of intercostal tissue at body temperature (37°C), but rather it is sufficient to determine the attenuation coefficient at room temperature (22°C), a much easier experimental procedure."

Agreement between participants' nutrient intakes as calculated with the NHANES I and ESHA nutrient databases was assessed using intraclass correlation analysis, linear regression analysis, and graphic methods. Intraclass correlation analysis demonstrated excellent concordance between most nutrient intakes, with coefficients above 0.95 for intakes of energy, carbohydrates, protein, cholesterol, and calcium; coefficients between 0.90 and 0.95 for intakes of total fat, saturated fat, potassium, and vitamin C; and coefficients of approximately 0.85 for intakes of sodium and vitamin A.

The objective of this study was to assess whether female ceramic workers also have an increased risk of silicosis and whether these women have decreased lung function related to silica exposure. Ceramic workers from Civitacastellana, Italy, were enrolled in health surveillance during the 1970s. A total of 642 women were under surveillance; a respiratory monitoring program was conducted from 1974 to 1987, with follow-up through 1991 that included annual chest radiography and measurement of lung function. Radiography findings were defined as silicosis if the chest films were ≥1/0 with small, rounded opacities. Multiple linear regression models for repeated measures (generalized estimating equations) were run to evaluate associations of forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) with years of exposure and radiograph opacities. Nine cases of silicosis were identified on the basis of radiographic evidence. Silicosis risk was not associated with smoking but was related to employment before 1970 and demonstrated a dose-response gradient for years of exposure. FVC and FEV1 both showed significant (p < 0.05) associations with duration of exposure and with positive radiography findings. The results for female ceramic workers are consistent with those for male employees regarding exposure to fibrogenic dusts."

Haemodialysis patients have impaired exercise tolerance that may be related to impaired carnitine availability and/or alterations in carnitine metabolism. As carnitine metabolism is sex- and age-related, we examined plasma free and esterified carnitine concentrations, muscle strength, and estimated exercise tolerance in female (n=51) and male (n=63) patients of different ages (18-86 years). Methods. Concentrations of free carnitine and acetyl-carnitine were determined in the plasma of patients. Isometric handgrip strength was measured using a dynamometer while exercise tolerance was predicted from scores for self-reported walking distance on the level and on an incline. Results. Plasma total carnitine concentration in the females was significantly lower than that of males (3 5.4 ± 1.3 and 42.4 ± 1.4 μmol/1, respectively, P<0.01). This was almost entirely due to the lower plasma free carnitine concentration of females when compared with the males (20.6 ± 0.9 and 26.3 ± 1.1 μmol/1, respectively, P < 0.05). Furthermore, plasma free carnitine concentrations were negatively correlated with age in females (r=-0.45, P<0.001) even when the linear effects of haemoglobin, albumin, body weight, time on dialysis, and muscle strength were removed from the regression analysis (partial correlation coefficient; pcc = -0.43, P = 0.018), but not in the males (r=0.03, P>0.05). Isometric handgrip strength and estimated exercise tolerance on the level were lower in females than males (138.9 ±10.9 and 259.0 ± 15.2 N, P < 0.001; and 3.5 ± 0.2 and 4.3 ± 0.2 P<0.05, respectively). Isometric handgrip strength and estimated exercise tolerance (walking distance on the level and on an incline) were positively correlated with plasma free carnitine concentrations in females, but not in the males. Conclusions. There was a strong relationship between plasma free carnitine concentrations and age in female patients, but not in males. It is unlikely that the reduction in plasma free carnitine in females was a direct causative factor in their reduced exercise tolerance, but probably reflects greater muscle de-conditioning/ atrophy with age in female patients."

Design - Randomized, double Latin square. Animals - 6 healthy adult dogs. Procedure - Anesthesia was induced and neuromuscular blockade achieved by IV administration of pancuronium bromide. Mechanical ventilation was used to induce conditions of standard ventilation, hyperventilation, and hypoventilation. While tidal volume was held constant, changes in minute volume ventilation and Paco2 were made by changing the respiratory rate. Arterial blood gas analysis was performed and ETCO2 measurements were obtained by use of either a mainstream or a sidestream capnographic analyzer. Results - A linear regression model and bias analysis were used to compare Paco2 and ETCO2 measurements; ETCO2 measurements obtained by both capnographs correlated well with Paco2. Compared with Paco2, mainstream ETCO2 values differed by 3.15 ± 4.89 mm Hg (mean bias ± SD), whereas the bias observed with the sidestream ETCO2 system was significantly higher (5.65 ± 5.57 mm Hg). Regardless of the device used to measure ETCO2, bias increased as Paco2 exceeded 60 mm Hg. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance - Although the mainstream capnograph was slightly more accurate, both methods of ETCO2 measurement correlated well with Paco2 and reflected changes in the ventilatory status. However, ETCO2 values > 45 mm Hg may inaccurately reflect the severity of hypoventilation as Paco2 may be underestimated during conditions of hypercapnia (Paco2 > 60 mm Hg)."

CLR makes some assumptions about the domain and the data set. Firstly, target value is assumed to be a function of feature values. Second assumption is that there are some linear approximations for this function in each subspace. Finally, there are enough training instances to determine subspaces and their linear approximations successfully. Tests indicate that if these approximations hold, CLR outperforms all other well-known machine-learning algorithms. Partitioning may continue until linear approximation fits all the instances in the training set - that generally occurs when the number of instances in the subspace is less than or equal to the number of features plus one. In other case, each new subspace will have a better fitting linear approximation. However, this will cause over fitting and gives less accurate results for the test instances. The stopping situation can be determined as no significant decrease or an increase in relative error. CLR uses a small portion of the training instances to determine the number of subspaces. The necessity of high number of training instances makes this algorithm suitable for data mining applications. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."

The dilution series ranged from <100 to 5,000,000 HCV RNA copies/ml and consisted of 32 points, assayed in triplicate in each assay. Thirty clinical samples ranging from 1,000 to 1,000,000 HCV RNA copies/Ml were assayed in duplicate. Deming regression analysis comparing the Amplicor HCV RNA international units-per-milliliter and copies-per-milliliter assays was calculated as follows: (Amplicor international units per milliliter) = 1.030(Amplicor copies per milliliter) - 0.392; R2 = 0.981; n = 28; Sy/x (standard error of the estimate) = 0.129. The linearity of the Amplicor international units-per-milliliter assay was as follows: observed = 0.886(expected) + 0.437; R2 = 0.983; n = 30. The linearity of the Superquant assay was as follows: observed= 0.918 (expected) + 0.436; R2 = 0.986; n = 32.

The Amplicor and Superquant assays were linear through the range of 600 to 600,000 IU of HCV RNA/ml and ∼300 to 5,000,000 HCV RNA copies/ml, respectively. The narrow range of the Amplicor assay means that some samples will require dilution and retesting for accurate quantification above 600,000 IU of HCV RNA/ml. The Amplicor and Superquant assays agreed well within the range of 600 to 600,000 IU of HCV RNA/ml (∼1,000 to ∼1,000,000 HCV RNA copies/ml). Overall, the Amplicor and Superquant assays agree well, and results obtained in one assay could be expected to compare well with results from the other when reported in copies per milliliter."

Nineteen consecutive OSAHS patients and 13 healthy subjects were selected. Ventilatory (ΔV'I/Sa,O2/BSA) and inspiratory neural drive (ΔP0.1/Sa,O2) responses to progressive isocapnic hypoxia were determined. Peripheral chemosensitivity was evaluated by the hypoxic withdrawal test, which measures the decrease in ventilation caused by two breaths of 100% oxygen (%ΔV'1). Withdrawal response and ventilatory and inspiratory neural drive responses to hypoxia were lower in OSAHS patients than in control subjects. In patients with OSAHS, %ΔV'I correlated significantly with ΔV'I/Sa,O2/BSA and with ΔP0.1/Sa,O2. On stepwise multiple linear regression analysis, a strong correlation between %ΔV'I and ΔP0.1/Sa,O2 was found. Moreover, %ΔV'I, ΔV'I/Sa,O2/BSA and ΔP0.1/Sa,O2 were significantly correlated with minimum arterial oxygen saturation and with arousal index. Obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome patients have a strong relationship between peripheral chemosensitivity and respiratory response to hypoxia, suggesting that hypoxic stimulation of central chemoreceptors is minimally relevant in obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome. Moreover, sensitivity of the carotid body in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome is related to sleep disruption and to nocturnal hypoxia."

Methods: Seventy-three women underwent ovarian hyperstimulation for IVF and embryo transfer. After follicle aspiration, recovered granulosa cells were stained by BCL2 monoclonal antibody with FITC and propidium iodide (PI). Fluorescence was detected by flowcytometry, then the apoptotic index (AI) and BCL2 positivity were assessed. Results: The pregnant group showed a significantly lower apoptotic index in granulosa cells compared with the nonpregnant group (p < 0.0001). Patient's age, basal serum FSH concentration, serum E2 concentrations at hCG day, number of retrieved oocytes, fertilization rates, number of embryos transferred, and BCL2 positivity were not different between the two groups. Linear regression analysis of AI to serum basal FSH showed a positive correlation. AI in granulosa cells of 6.14% or below could predict a successful pregnancy with a sensitivity of 87.5% and a specificity of 73.7%.

Typical applications include (1) testing for trend in annual flood data, as a possible consequence of changing land cover or other factors; (2) testing for trend in annual maximum rainfall intensities of different durations, as a possible consequence of climate change; and (3) testing how annual maximum rainfall intensity is related to weather conditions at the times that annual maximum intensities were recorded. Given a first estimate of the Gumbel scale parameter α, the coefficients β of explanatory variables x are estimated by casting the model in GLM form, and the scale parameter α is updated by solution of relevant maximum likelihood equation for this parameter. The parameters α, β can be readily estimated using currently available statistical software for fitting GLMs, which can also be used to test the significance of trends in annual flood data for which the Gumbel distribution is a plausible hypothesis. A plotting procedure to indicate departures from the Gumbel hypothesis is also given. The proposed procedure avoids the illogicality in which, when a trend in flood data is suspected, it is tested either by linear regression methods that assume Normally distributed residuals, or by nonparametric methods, both of which discard the Gumbel hypothesis. Simulated samples from Gumbel distributions were used to compare estimates of linear trend obtained by (1) the GLM procedure and (2) straightforward use of a Newton-Raphson procedure to locate the maximum of the likelihood surface; the GLM procedure converged more rapidly and was far less subject to numerical instabilities. Simulated samples from Gumbel distributions were also used to compare estimates of a linear trend coefficient β given by the GLM procedure, with estimates of β obtained by simple linear regression (LR). The variance of the distribution of GLM estimates of β was less than the variance of the distribution of LR estimates, while comparison of the powers of the two tests showed that GLM was more powerful than LR at detecting the existence of small trends, although for large linear trends there was little to choose between the two methods."

In the present study conducted on acute (10-20 days) streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats we examined: 1) cardiac baroreflex sensitivity, assessed by the slope of the linear regression between phenylephrine- or sodium nitroprusside-induced changes in arterial pressure and reflex changes in heart rate (HR) in conscious rats; 2) aortic baroreceptor function by means of the relationship between systolic arterial pressure and aortic depressor nerve (ADN) activity, in anesthetized rats, and 3) bradycardia produced by electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve or by the iv injection of methacholine in anesthetized animals. Reflex bradycardia (-1.4 ± 0.1 vs -1.7 ± 0.1 bpm/mmHg) and tachycardia (-2.1 ± 0.3 vs -3.0 ± 0.2 bpm/mmHg) were reduced in the diabetic group. The gain of the ADN activity relationship was similar in control (1.7 ± 0.1% max/mmHg) and diabetic (1.5 ± 0.1% max/mmHg) animals. The HR response to vagal nerve stimulation with 16, 32 and 64 Hz was 13, 16 and 14% higher, respectively, than the response of STZ-treated rats. The HR response to increasing doses of methacholine was also higher in the diabetic group compared to control animals. Our results confirm the baroreflex dysfunction detected in previous studies on short-term diabetic rats. Moreover, the normal baroreceptor function and the altered HR responses to vagal stimulation or methacholine injection suggest that the efferent limb of the baroreflex is mainly responsible for baroreflex dysfunction in this model of diabetes."

Methods: A consecutive series of 141 eyes with POAG or ocular hypertension was prospectively recruited. One hundred five eyes were treated by combined trabeculotomy and cataract surgery (TPI group) and 36 eyes were treated by cataract surgery alone (PI group). The prognostic factors that correlate with successful IOP control after surgery were screened using the Cox multivariate analyses based on three definitions of success: IOP <21 mm Hg, <17 mm Hg, and <15 mm Hg, with or without eye drops. The factors examined were types of procedure (TPI or PI), age, sex, preoperative IOP level, number of preoperative antiglaucoma medications, eyes with high myopia (>-10 diopters), postoperative hyphema lasting longer than 4 days, and postoperative transient IOP spike (>30 mm Hg). Results: TPI was a significant factor for IOP reduction in the three definition-based multivariate analyses. Other factors included patient age, preoperative IOP level, and postoperative IOP spike. The statistical significance of age was further confirmed using linear regression analysis and the Spearman correlation coefficient (Rs) between age and IOP level 3 months after surgery (R2 = 0.13, P = 0.0002 and Rs = -0.44, P < 0.0001, respectively in the TPI group). The success rates for IOP control <17 mm Hg and <15 mm Hg were significantly higher in patients 70 years and older than in younger patients, as determined using the Kaplan-Meier life table analysis with the Mantel-Cox logrank test in both TPI and PI groups. IOP reduction was significantly greater in older patients than in younger patients at every follow-up visit for up to 1.5 years for the TPI group and up to 1 year for the PI group. Conclusion: Advanced age is a favorable prognostic factor for successful control of IOP after combined trabeculotomy and cataract surgery. Older patients with POAG and visually significant cataract are good candidates for combined trabeculotomy and cataract surgery."

The Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) and the SF-36 instruments were used. The behavioral Model of Health Services Utilization was used to characterize independent variables and their relationships to HQL. Independent variables included predisposing (age, gender, education, race, number of comorbidities, years with asthma, social support, health-belief questions); enabling (income, number of metered dose inhaler (MDI) instructors, perceived inconvenience of accessing the physician); and illness level (perceived and symptom-derived asthma severity). Multivariate linear regression models were developed to examine the relationships between the independent variables and the domain and summary scores of the AQLQ and the SF-36. The survey response rate was 63% (n=603). for the AQLQ, symptom-derived severity, perceived severity, education level, and the health-belief factor Barriers were significant in all five models. Symptom-derived severity had consistently higher standardized regression coefficients than perceived severity. Barriers had the highest coefficient in all but the Symptoms domain model. Number of Comorbidities was significant in all eight domain and two summary score SF-36 models. Symptom-derived and/or perceived severity were also significant in all but the Mental Health domain model. Other frequently significant variables included the health-belief factor Barriers and Yearly Household Income.

In the present study, we investigated whether plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) is related to the distinct patterns of left ventricular (LV) geometry and LV diastolic function in treated essential hypertension. In 92 patients with chronically treated essential hypertension, two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiographic examinations were performed and LV inflow velocities were measured for evaluation of LV diastolic function. When patients were divided into four groups by the different LV geometric patterns, PAC in patients with eccentric hypertrophy was significantly higher than in those with concentric hypertrophy (15.2±2.1 vs. 10.0±0.7 ng/dl, p<0.01). However, the ratio of the peak velocity of early diastolic filling to that of atrial filling (E/A), an index of LV diastolic function, was significantly decreased in patients with concentric hypertrophy compared with those showing normal geometry. In the relationship between PAC and LV diastolic function, PAC was negatively correlated with E/A (r=-0.35, p<0.05) only in the subgroup with normal relative wall thickness (i.e., without the concentric change in LV geometry). A multiple linear regression analysis showed that PAC was one of the independent determinants of E/A in the overall subject group. These observations indicate that PAC is associated with the eccentric change in LV geometry in patients with treated essential hypertension and also suggest that the increase in PAC participates in the impairment of LV diastolic function apart from the concentric change in LV geometry, although concentric hypertrophy clearly impairs LV diastolic function."

However, there are few published studies of related health care resource utilization. Resource utilization, length of stay (LOS) and direct medical costs were characterized in a cohort of patients admitted for nonmalignant LGIH to centres in Ontario. Methods: Consecutive admissions for LGIH were identified at four Ontario hospitals. Profiles of resource utilization, LOS and estimates of direct medical costs were compiled through detailed chart review and adaptation of an administrative database. All centres were participants in the Ontario Case Cost Project. Linear regression models of log-transformed data were constructed to identify demographic variables predictive of LOS and case cost. Results: Among 124 patients enrolled (mean age 58.8 years) the average case cost was $4,832 (SD $7,187) for 7.5 days in hospital (SD 12.0). Diverticular disease was the bleeding source most often identified (34.6%), followed by hemorrhoids (13.7%) and ischemic colitis (9.7%). Older age and comorbid illness, specifically coronary artery disease (CAD), were associated with both increased LOS and higher case cost in univariate regression analyses. Age persisted as the lone independent predictor of LOS in the multivariate model (P<0.05, R2=0.076), and age and CAD were both independent predictors of cost (P<0.05, R2=0.109) in a stepwise multiple linear regression analysis. Neither sex nor nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use predicted LOS or cost. Conclusions: Admissions for acute LGIH are associated with significant resource utilization, particularly among elderly patients with CAD."

Methods: Eleven young men performed a maximal aerobic capacity test, controlled frequency breathing (0.25 Hz), and three Valsalva maneuvers before and after 4 wk of exercise training on a cycle ergometer (30 min at ≥ 70% max heart rate, 3 sessions · week-1). During controlled breathing and Valsalva straining, we recorded the electrocardiogram, noninvasive beat-by-beat arterial pressure, and peroneal nerve muscle sympathetic traffic at the popliteal fossa (pre and postexercise sympathetic recordings were obtainable in 7 of 11 subjects). Vagal-cardiac tone was estimated from R-R interval standard deviations during controlled frequency breathing. Cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity was derived from increases of R-R intervals as functions of increases in systolic pressures with linear regression analysis during phase IV pressure increases, and sympathetic sensitivity was derived from the quotient of total muscle sympathetic nerve activity and diastolic pressure changes during phase II pressure reductions. Results: Exercise training increased VO2 max (3.38 ± 0.10 pre-, and 3.64 ± 0.11 L · min-1 postexercise; mean ± SE; P = 0.04), R-R interval standard deviations (75 ± 0.12 pre- and 94 ± 0.14 ms postexercise; mean ± SE; P = 0.03), and cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity (15.0 ± 1.1 pre-, and 25.0 ms · mm Hg-1 ± 4.0 postexercise; mean ± SE; P = 0.03).

There was a linear association of α-EGR with tHcy plasma concentrations (P = 0.009), which was not observed for α-ETK. Among red blood cell vitamins, α-EGR was the only predictor of tHcy levels (P = 0.035), whereas α-ETK, red blood cell pyridoxal-5-phosphate supply (α-EGOT) and red blood cell folate levels had no effect. The risk for having a high tHcy plasma levels within the fourth quartile (plasma tHcy >38.3 μmol/L) was increased by an α-EGR > median (odds ratio, 4.706; 95% confidence interval, 1.124 to 19.704; P = 0.026). By way of contrast, α-ETK had no effect in these analyses. Independent predictors of tHcy plasma levels were serum albumin, α-EGR, red blood cell folate, and certain MTHFR genotypes. A logistic regression analysis showed that the MTHFR genotype is a predictor for having a tHcy plasma concentration within the fourth quartile. In summary, riboflavin availability, as measured by α-EGR, is a determinant of fasting tHcy plasma levels in peritoneal dialysis patients. This finding may have implications for tHcy lowering therapy in individuals with end-stage renal disease."

The study population was composed of 182 Chinese retired coal miners who had similar dust exposure histories. Among them, 71 were cases with CWP and III were controls. Chest radiographs were classified according to International Labour Organization Criteria (ILO, 1980). Individual dust exposure variables were estimated from work histories, and smoking information was obtained from interviews. Serum concentrations of TNF-α, TNF-α receptors (p55, p75), IL-6, and IL-6 receptor were measured by ELISA techniques. Mean serum levels of p55, p75 and IL-6 were significantly higher in cases than in controls (P≤0.01 for each comparison by crude analyses). Results from logistic regression models, adjusted for age, dust exposure variables, and smoking habits, found similar associations between soluble p55 and p75 levels and the presence of CWP Linear regression analysis revealed that CWP radiographic stage (by ILO criteria) was significantly correlated with the individual serum concentrations of p55, p75 and IL-6. Serum concentrations of all measured cytokines were not correlated to age, dustexposure, or smoking, but there were correlations between soluble p75 and p55 levels, and between p75 and IL-6 levels. The results of this study suggest that serum levels of TNF receptors and IL-6 are associated with the fibrotic process of CWP and serum cytokine levels may be correlated with the severity of CWP. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - A total of 239 type 2 diabetic participants in the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) Study (76 women) aged 50-75 years were examined before fenofibrate intervention. Patients underwent carotid ultrasonography for determination of IMT. IGF-I, IGF binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1), IGFBP-3, cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B (apoB), lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)), glucose, HbA 1c, and C-peptide were measured in fasting samples. Patients were divided in groups without (n = 168) and with (n = 71) clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD). RESULTS - Partial correlations adjusted for age, sex, BMI, and diabetes duration showed an inverse association of IGFBP-1 with C-peptide (r = -0.24, P = 0.018) and with maximal IMT (r = -0.42, P < 0.001), whereas IGF I and IGFBP-3 correlated positively with several risk-promoting lipid parameters. In linear regression analysis controlling for age, sex, BMI, diabetes duration, and presence or absence of oral antihyperglycemic or insulin medication, determinants of IMT were age, IGFBP-1, pulse pressure, Lp(a), diabetes duration, and insulin treatment. IGFBP-1 persisted in the model for subjects with CVD. CONCLUSIONS - In summary, a decrease in IGFBP-1 is a marker of carotid IMT thickening in patients with type 2 diabetes."

The genotoxity of PhIP requires an initial cytochrome P450-mediated N-oxidation followed by N-O-esterification catalyzed generally by N-acetyltransferases and sulfotransferases. This study examined the urinary excretion of N2-(β-1-glucosiduronyl) -2-hydroxyamino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine-the major human urinary N-oxidation metabolite of PhIP-and determined its relationship to individual activity levels of cytochrome P4501A2 (CYP1A2) and N-acetyltransferase (NAT2). The subjects (33 males and 33 females) in the dietary study were phenotyped for their CYP1A2 and NAT2 activity prior to consumption of meat-based diet, and urine collections were obtained 0-12 and 12-24 h after ingestion of the meal. Acidic hydrolysis of pyridine and its d3-analog to form their respective deaminated products 2-hydroxy-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (2-OH-PhIP) was used in the assay. The products after derivatization were analyzed by capillary gas chromatography-negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry with selective ion monitoring. The amount of N2-(β-1-glucosiduronyl)-2- hydroxyamino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine measured as the acid hydrolysis product 2-OH-PhIP in the 0-12 h urine was 20.2 ± 8.0% (mean ± SD) of the ingested dose; the median was 18.8% and the range varied from 5.4 to 39.6% within the group. In a subset (n = 18) of samples from individual urine collected from the 12-24 h period, an average value of 4.4 ± 2.5% (± SD) of the dose was recovered. The excretion of N2- (β-glucosiduronyl)-2-hydroxyamino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine in the 0-12 h urine was significantly related to the quantity of PhIP ingested for all subjects (r = 0.52, P <0.0001). Linear regression analysis of the relationship between the excretion level of N2-(β-1-glucosiduronyl)- 2-hydroxyamino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo [4,5-b]pyridine, adjusted for meat intake and CYP1A2 activity in the combined group of males and females showed a low association (r = 0.25, P = 0.05). There was no association between the amount of N2-(β-1-glucosiduronyl)- 2-hydroxyamino-1-methyl- 6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine in urine and NAT2 activity levels of the subjects nor with the age of the subjects. N2-(β-1-glucosiduronyl)-2-hydroxyamino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b] pyridine comprised a significant proportion of the ingested dose in some individuals; however, considerable variation was found within the group. The results indicate that interindividual differences in the rates of N-oxidation of 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine, as well as phase II glucuronidation reactions regulate the formation of this metabolite in humans."

This is inferred from both reanalysis data from the U.S. National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) and the Kaplan sea surface temperature data set. Two phases of winterly North Atlantic atmosphere-ocean covariability are identified by means of linear regression and correlation analysis. During the recent decades since the late 1960s/early 1970s and during the first 3 decades of the twentieth century, the North Atlantic SST is strongly correlated to the regional atmospheric circulation in the North Atlantic sector, i.e., the North Atlantic Oscillation. During these periods the NAO index, defined as the difference of normalized sea level pressures on the Azores and Iceland, is characterized by pronounced decadal variability and by mainly positive values. In contrast, the NAO index is only weakly correlated to the North Atlantic SST from the 1930s to the early 1960s, when the NAO index is characterized by weak decadal variability. Remote influences, in particular from the tropical Pacific region, become important, especially for the SST in the western tropical North Atlantic. Copyright 2002 by the American Geophysical Union."

Patients were tested on attention, memory, speed of information processing, and executive functioning. Questionnaires aimed at measuring self-perceived cognitive functioning (CFQ) and HRQOL (SF-36) were administered. Mann Whitney-U tests were used to compare the two groups. Linear regression analysis was performed to identify the epilepsy and medication-related factors that are associated with cognitive functioning and HRQOL. Patients scored lower on measures of attention (P = 0.03), learning (P = 0.02) and speed of information processing (P = 0.00). Mental aspects of HRQOL such as fatigue were lower (P = 0.00), whereas physical functioning was unaffected.

Age at onset, duration of epilepsy, seizure type, seizure frequency, localisation, years on CBZ, and CBZ dosage were not related to cognitive functioning or HRQOL. Patients with partial epilepsy, even when able to maintain regular jobs, have impaired cognition and HRQOL that cannot be attributed to their epilepsy history or CBZ dosage or years of CBZ intake.

Methods and Results: Forty-five patients underwent multiplane transoesophageal echocardiography. In addition to Doppler and two-dimensional echocardiography, data for three-dimensional echocardiography reconstruction were obtained during transoesophageal echocardiography. Left atrial appendage ejection fraction based on three-dimensional echocardiography volume measurements (EFv) and two-dimensional echocardiography area measurements (EFa), coupled with other echocardiographic data, were related to left atrial appendage late peak emptying velocity, a frequently used indicator of left atrial appendage function. Multiple regression analysis has revealed a significant association of peak emptying velocity with EFv (P<0.0001), spontaneous echocardiographic contrast (P=0.001), tricuspid regurgitation (P=0.03) and left ventricular hypertrophy (P=0.05). No significant relation was observed between peak emptying velocity and EFa, presence or absence of atrial fibrillation, left ventricular dysfunction, mitral stenosis and insufficiency, left atrial dilatation, pulmonary venous peak systolic, diastolic and peak reverse flow velocity at atrial contraction as well as left atrial appendage volumes derived from two-dimensional echocardiography and three-dimensional echocardiography. In a simple linear correlation, the degree of association between peak emptying velocity and EFv was higher as between peak emptying velocity and EFa (r=0.7 vs 0.4, both P<0.001). Observer variabilities for calculating EFv were considerably lower than for two-dimensional echocardiography derived EFa. Ejection fractions determined by two-dimensional echocardiography area measurements at 45°, 90° and 135° cutplane angulations were related to EFv only at 135°. Conclusions: Left atrial appendage ejection fraction calculation by three-dimensional echocardiography is feasible, more accurate than by two-dimensional echocardiography and has lower observer variability. Furthermore, an optimal cutplane angulation of the left atrial appendage view at 135° has been demonstrated. © 2002 The European Society of Cardiology. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

We also found that manipulation of dietary calcium does not yield sufficiently high or low serum calcium levels to achieve the minimum and maximum PTH levels needed for set point estimations. Therefore, we developed a new method for in vivo evaluation of the relative set point in mice. Intraperitoneal injection of calcium gluconate caused progressive increases in serum calcium over 120 minutes, with corresponding decreases in serum PTH levels. Intraperitoneal injection of Na2-EGTA caused a nadir of serum calcium at 30 minutes and a corresponding peak value of serum PTH. The lowest and highest serum calcium concentrations achieved were 6.7 mg/dl and 10.0 mg/dl, respectively. Linear regression analyses indicated high correlation coefficients (serum calcium vs. serum PTH; r = 0.969). To obtain the additional data points needed for set point estimation, blood was collected 30 minutes after intraperitoneal injection by tail nicking from three mice once a day, on 8 consecutive days, using multiple doses of calcium gluconate or Na2-EGTA. The lowest and highest serum calcium concentrations achieved were 5.0 mg/dl and 11.4 mg/dl. Maximum and minimum PTH levels were indeed observed, and a sigmoidal curve with a set point of 7.8 mg/dl was readily generated by the four-parameter model that was fit using a nonlinear mixed effects statistical approach. This protocol for in vivo set point analysis should be applicable in the future study of multiple genetically engineered and pharmacologically treated mouse models."

We hypothesised that ACE genotype might affect rate of AAA expansion via modulating long-term structural changes associated with RAS activation. Methods: fifty-eight patients (50 M, mean age 70 years, mean initial aneurysm size 4.3 cm) with current or previous AAA and serial (>3) annual ultrasound measurements of antero-posterior AAA size provided a sample of leucocyte DNA for ACE genotyping. AAA expansion rate (cm per year) for individual subjects was calculated by linear regression. Results: median AAA expansion rate was 0.28 cm/year (range 0-1.8 cm/year), and the genotype distribution included DD (n = 14), DI (n = 29) and II (n = 15). Corresponding median AAA expansion rates for each of the three genetic subgroups were 0.22, 0.32 and 0.30 cm/year, respectively (p = 0.6, nonparametric). Conclusions: the wide inter-individual variability in AAA expansion rate is likely to reflect complex genetic and environmental interactions, but the lack of any relationship with ACE genotype suggests that differences in vascular ACE activity in aortic tissue are not major determinants of the variability in rate of AAA dilatation. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

To assess whether this population has high levels of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), a cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, we investigated subjects belonging to poor socio-economic strata in urban slums and compared them to healthy control subjects from non-slum urban areas of New Delhi. Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Subjects from a previously carried out cross-sectional study, Delhi Urban Slum Project (DUSP) were divided into two groups: Group-1 (n = 56) included subjects dwelling in slum area, having at least one risk factor (hypertension, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia), while group-2 (n = 60) consisted of subjects without any risk factor dwelling in the slum area. A third group (n = 29) of non-obese subjects without any risk factor living in non-slum urban area was included for comparison. Measurements included; body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (W-HR), four skinfolds, percentage body fat, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), serum lipids, and serum levels of sICAM-1. Results: Though statistically not significant, mean level of sICAM-1 was higher in group-1 (718.5 ± 232.8 ng/ml) as compared to the other groups. Of note, 35% of subjects in group-1 (p < 0.05 as compared to other two groups), and 25.3% of all subjects had levels of sICAM-1 in uppermost quartile (> 850 ng/ml). Partial correlation coefficients (R) of sICAM-1 levels with various parameters adjusted for age were statistically significant for BMI (R = 0.27, p < 0.05) in group-1; W-HR (R = 0.26, p < 0.05) and BMI (R = 0.19, p < 0.05) for group-2; and FPG (R = 0.17, p < 0.05) for all the subjects considered together. For females, the levels of sICAM-1 were significantly higher in the following: BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 (p = 0.04) and FPG > 7 mmol/l (p < 0.05). Multiple linear regression analysis suggests that an increment in BMI by one kg/m2 would correspond to an increase in the levels of sICAM-1 by 8.5 units controlling for the influence of age and W-HR in the pooled data of all subjects. Conclusions: High percentage of subjects had levels of sICAM-1 in the upper quartile in the study, particularly those dwelling in the slum area and having coronary risk factor (s). The levels of sICAM-1 strongly correlated to the anthropometric and metabolic parameters, particularly in females. These observations are of potential importance for the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in this population, though further studies are needed to predict those prone to the complications of atherosclerosis, based on sICAM-1 levels, as has been observed in other ethnic groups."

Analytical techniques included linear and logistic regression modeling. A semiquantitative meta-analysis evaluated 38 earlier publications that contain information on height at the onset of diabetes. Results. Children <1 year of age were shorter than their peers by 1 standard deviation, whereas those from 3 years to near puberty were taller by approximately 0.3 standard deviation. Adjusting for parental height caused this difference to disappear for the older children but not for the infants. The meta-analysis results paralleled these observations. Conclusions. Taller children generally seem to experience increased risk for development of diabetes mellitus type 1, except perhaps during infancy or early adolescence. This observation may have implications regarding pathogenesis of this disorder."

Over a range of solution concentrations of 0.025 - 2.00 mg P I−1, all three sorption equations were found to fit the data well (R2 = 0.934 - 0.996). The values of the coefficients of the different equations were more accurately estimated by the Freundlich and Temkin models, whilst the Langmuir model was a slightly better indicator of adsorbed P. A multiple regression analysis between sorption coefficients and selected soil properties showed citrate bicarbonate dithionite-AI to be an important factor in P sorption. Other soil constituents important in P sorption included clay percentage, organic matter, citrate bicarbonate dithionite-Fe and Bray 2 P content. Although useful in identifying soil properties responsible for P sorption, the regression equations were too cumbersome and imprecise to be of any practical use in characterising P isotherms routinely. It was also apparent from the regression analysis that, except for the Langmuir maximum and Temkin P buffer power index, the other sorption coefficients require the inclusion of a measure of native P content to be true soil characteristics, when constructing isotherms. Limitations, which this constraint imposes on the routine use of isotherms for the purpose of determining sorption coefficients, are discussed. © 2002 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

To evaluate the seroprevalence of Chlamydia pneumoniae and age, gender and smoking habits in stable asthmatic patients. Methods. Over a period of 3 months, 197 adult patients affected by intermittent-to-severe chronic asthma were enrolled from 16 respiratory disease units in the south of Italy. As a control group, we tested 185 healthy, non-asthmatic subjects matched for age and gender, recruited among hospital staff. All patients were submitted to clinical examination, spirometry and blood collection for C. pneumoniae serology. The presence of infection was investigated by microimmunofluorescence (Micro-IF Test) for C. pneumoniae-specific IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies. Results. C. pneumoniae IgG titers ≥1:64 were detected in 30.4% of asthmatics and in 30.8% of controls. Correlation of age, gender and smoking habit with C. pneumoniae seropositivity was evaluated by linear regression analysis. Age was significantly associated with C. pneumoniae IgG titer ≥1 : 64 when seropositive asthmatics were tested. Moreover, C. pneumoniae seroprevalence was higher among smokers with a diagnosis of chronic asthma. Conclusions. The seroprevalence of C. pneumoniae in stable asthmatics was comparable with the controls; therefore, the study does not support the association between C. pneumoniae antibody titers and stable asthma. However, the analysis for likely confounders such as age, gender and smoking status suggests a possible association of enhanced susceptibility to C. pneumoniae infection with age and smoking habitus."

Methods: In this prospective study, the fetal aortic isthmus was evaluated in 110 low-risk pregnant women at between 30 and 40 weeks of gestation and 42 pregnant women who were at high risk for congenital heart defects. From coronal echocardiographic images of the connection between the aorta and ductus arteriosus, the internal diameter of the aorta was measured at the middle of the isthmus, at the point of the isthmus just proximal to the entry of the ductus arteriosus and at the descending aorta below the entry of the ductus arteriosus. Results: Correlation coefficients for the diameter of each aortic segment when related to gestational age varied from r = 0.60 to r = 0.80 (P < 0.001 for each), and growth curves were derived from the third and 97th percentiles about each linear regression analysis.

In one fetus of the high-risk patients, a contraductal shelf and the accompanying area of tubular isthmic hypoplasia were suspected and a diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta was subsequently confirmed after birth. In two fetuses with growth restriction and one fetus with intestinal atresia, the isthmus diameters were below the third percentile but the ratios of the isthmus end to the middle of the aortic isthmus were all normal and no cardiac anomalies were detected after birth.

Because little is known about the impact of outpatient diabetes management on lipid outcomes, we examined changes in lipid profiles in urban African-Americans who attended a structured diabetes care program. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - A retrospective analysis of initial and 1-year follow-up lipid values was conducted among patients selected from a computerized registry of an urban outpatient diabetes clinic. The independent effects of lipid-specific medications, glycemic control, and weight loss on serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were evaluated by analysis of covariance and multiple linear regression. RESULTS - In 345 patients (91% African-American and 95% with type 2 diabetes), HbA1c decreased from 9.3% at the initial visit to 8.2% at 1 year (P < 0.001); total and LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels were significantly lower, and HDL cholesterol was higher. After stratifying based on use of lipid-specific therapy, different outcomes were observed. In 243 patients not taking dyslipidemia medications, average total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations at 1 year were similar to initial values, whereas in 102 patients receiving pharmacotherapy, these lipid levels were all lower at 1 year relative to baseline (P < 0.001). Mean HDL cholesterol increased regardless of lipid treatment status (P < 0.001). After adjusting for other variables, changes in LDL cholesterol concentration were associated only with use of lipid-specific agents (P = 0.003), whereas improved HbA1c and weight loss had no independent effect. Lipid therapy, improved glycemic control, and weight loss were not independently related to changes in HDL cholesterol and therefore could not account for the positive changes observed. Use of lipid-directed medications, improvement in glycemic control, and weight loss all resulted in significant declines in triglyceride levels but only improved HbA1c and weight loss had an independent effect. CONCLUSIONS - Among urban African-Americans, diabetes management led to favorable changes in HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels, but improved glycemic control and weight loss had no independent effect on LDL cholesterol concentration. Initiation of pharmacologic therapy to treat high LDL cholesterol levels should be considered early in the course of diabetes management to reach recommended targets and reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications in this patient population."

A positive regression between the plasma cholesterol level and the dietary myristic acid level was observed (r = 0.60, P < 0.0001). However, it is noteworthy that the increase in plasma total cholesterol only reflects an increase in the level of HDL-cholesterol. In parallel, the mass SR-BI decreased linearly with the increased level of myristic acid in the diet, whereas the LDL-R did not change.

Sites were selected to represent a range of phosphorus (P) buffering capacities (PBC) and were analysed for a series of chemical and physical properties before receiving P fertiliser treatments. A single application of P fertiliser in the form of triple superphosphate (TSP), single superphosphate (SSP), or TSP and lime (5 t/ha) was applied at amounts ranging from 0 to 280 kg P/ha at the start of the experiment, whilst treatments of 35 and 70 kg P/ha were reapplied at 6-monthly intervals. Soils were analysed for bicarbonate-extractable P concentration, using both the Olsen P and Colwell P methods, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 months after P fertiliser was applied. A strong positive linear relationship existed at all sites and time periods between the amounts of P applied as a single application and both the Olsen P and Colwell P concentrations. The slopes of these relationships measured the change in extractable P concentration per unit of P applied (ΔEP) and the rate of decline in ΔEP values represented the decline in the effectiveness of the P fertiliser with increasing time from application. The decline in these ΔEP values varied with soil type. The ΔEP values of some low to moderate P buffered soils remained 2-3 times higher compared with the most highly buffered soils, after 30 months. Despite this, the decline in ΔEP values between 6 and 30 months was difficult to predict using a single soil property. Multiple linear regressions involving a measure of PBC and either organic carbon or exchangeable hydrogen were useful methods of predicting the decline in ΔEP values across the 9 field sites examined in this study. In general, the reapplication of P fertiliser every 6 months resulted in significantly higher extractable P concentrations compared with the same rates applied in a single application, across all sites and rates of P applied. The application of SSP, TSP, and TSP and lime had little impact on ΔEP values 18-30 months after treatments were applied."

To achieve a high dynamic reserve (DR) and optimize resolution, we have tested a number of aqueous mixtures containing alcohols and acetonitrile (ACN). The optimum buffer for the analysis of C2-C18 ACAs, in terms of sensitivity, resolution, and speed, is an aqueous mixture of 40% ACN, 30% ethanol, and 1 mM Tris at apparent pH 7.4 (adjusted with ascorbic acid). Under this condition, the DR is greater than 1000, thereby the limits of detection for acids are in the range of sub-μM to μM. Linear plots show that the dynamic ranges for the analysis of ACAs are at least two decades in concentration, with regression coefficients all greater than 0.98. The relative standard deviations of the migration times and peak heights for all ACAs are less than 2.0%.

The wind climate estimations were compared with observed winds at the field site, with respect to mean wind speed, wind direction, wind speed frequency distribution and the relative frequency of winds above 6 m s-1. All models performed reasonably well with data from Sturup and Mesan surface wind, but gave less reliable results with the Mesan geostrophic data. The estimated frequency of winds above 6 m s-1 was in general lower than the observed frequency. Overall, best results were obtained with WASP in combination with measurements from Sturup."

Traditional robust regression methods assume that the noise distribution is symmetric, and they downweight the influence of so-called outliers. When the noise distribution is asymmetric, these methods yield biased regression estimators. Motivated by data-mining problems for the insurance industry, we propose a new approach to robust regression tailored to deal with asymmetric noise distribution. The main idea is to learn most of the parameters of the model using conditional quantile estimators (which are biased but robust estimators of the regression) and to learn a few remaining parameters to combine and correct these estimators, to minimize the average squared error in an unbiased way. Theoretical analysis and experiments show the clear advantages of the approach. Results are on artificial data as well as insurance data, using both linear and neural network predictors."

Thus, chronic exposure to high levels of circulating and tissue ACE may well predispose to vascular wall thickening and atherosclerosis. However, the effect of the ACE gene on carotid atherosclerosis remains controversial. We investigated the association between ACE gene I/D polymorphism and risk factor-dependent augmentation of carotid arterial remodeling in subjects with several risk factors for atherosclerosis. We evaluated sclerotic lesions of the common carotid artery with intima-media thickness (IMT) by ultrasonography in 184 patients (mean age±SD, 67±14 years old) and studied whether any risk factor-gene interactions were associated with carotid atherosclerosis. Out of the 184 subjects, 71 had the ACE II genotype, 87 the ID genotype and 26 the DD genotype. There was no significant difference in IMT among the three ACE genotypes. In total subjects, multiple regression analysis showed that age, total-cholesterol (T-C), and HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) were significantly associated with IMT. However, the association between risk factors and IMT was genotype-specific. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and HDL-C were significantly associated with IMT in ACE D carriers (DD+ID), but not in subjects with the ACE II genotype. Similarly, T-C was significantly associated with IMT only in subjects with the ACE II genotype. A general linear model of the interaction between the ACE genotype and the conventional risk factors showed that the SBP-ACE genotype interaction were significantly associated with IMT (F=7.915; p=0.005). This finding further supports the idea that analysis of risk factor-gene interaction could be a useful tool for deriving specific predictive information about the development of atherosclerosis."

Although high plasma CRP levels in the acute phase strongly indicate a poor early clinical outcome of patients with MI, the impact of CRP levels on late left ventricular (LV) function and remodeling, which are closely associated with long-term prognosis, remains unknown. Hypothesis: Acute plasma CRP levels may predict late LV function and remodeling after MI. Methods: We prospectively studied 12 consecutive patients with a first acute anterior MI recanalized by angioplasty. We measured plasma CRP levels on Days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7, and calculated the area under the curve (AUC). We also measured plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels on Day 3 as the referential indicator of LV dysfunction and late LV remodeling. Late LV indices were independently assessed on a left ventriculogram obtained at 5.3 months to estimate the extent of LV remodeling. Results: Plasma CRP reached its peak at Day 2.8 (8.68 ± 4.57 mg/dl). On linear regression analysis, the AUC of CRP (35.21 ± 19.33 mg/dl × day) correlated positively with BNP (316.5 ± 418.6 pg/ml) (r = 0.646, p = 0.023). The AUC of CRP, peak CRP, and BNP correlated significantly with late LV indices, Among these, the AUC of CRP showed the best correlation with end-diastolic volume index (r = 0.765, p = 0.004), end-systolic volume index (r = 0.907, p<0.001), and ejection fraction (r = - 0.862, p<0.001). Conclusions: Patients with high plasma CRP levels may be at risk for late LV dysfunction and remodeling; theoretically, their long-term prognosis may be poor. Measuring plasma CRP levels may provide valuable information for long-term risk stratification after MI."

The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between habitual physical activity (HPA) during life and bone mineral density (BMD) in men aged 50 years and older. Methods. A total of 326 men aged 50 years and older, volunteers living in Saão Paulo city, Brazil, were studied. BMD was measured in the whole body, femoral neck, Ward's triangle, trochanter, and lumbar spine (L2-L4) with a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometer. The HPA data were collected with questionnaires inquiring about physical exercise and occupational physical activity in the past and during the past 12 months and leisure and locomotor physical activity in the preceding 12 months. The relationship between BMD and HPA was analyzed using multiple linear regression models adjusted for age and body mass index (BMI). Results. Practice of physical exercise in the past 10-20 years and leisure and locomotor physical activity in the preceding 12 months showed a significant positive correlation with BMD of whole body, femoral neck, trochanter, and lumbar spine, and this association was independent of age and BMI. Conclusions. HPA can contribute to preserving BMD in men aged 50 years and older in Brazil, when it is practiced in the past 10-20 years and even in the present. © Oxford University Press 2002."

Methods: Thirty-five healthy subjects and 45 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), aged from 38 to 80 years (mean age: 64.6 ± 12.2 years), underwent tonometry with the Ocuton S tonometer in one eye chosen at random. The intra- and interobserver variability between two operators (kappa coefficient), the Ocuton S/Goldmann correlation and the reliability of self-tonometry were evaluated by performing two tonometries on each patient in subgroups. Each tonometry was considered as the mean of three consecutive measurements. Central ultrasonic pachymetry, keratometry and corneal biomicroscopy were also evaluated. Results: The intra- and interobserver variability ranged from 0.38 to 0.66. The difference between the means of intraocular pressure (IOP) with the Ocuton S (24.4 ± 4.7 mmHg) and the Goldmann tonometer (18.1 ± 4.7 mmHg) was statistically significant (p < 0.0001). Linear regression analysis revealed a good Ocuton S/Goldmann correspondence (r = 0.88, p = 0.0001). However, IOP values detected with the Ocuton were consistently overestimated, compared to those detected with the Goldmann tonometer. The correlation between corneal thickness and IOP was statistically significant both for the Goldmann (r = 0.510, p = 0.021) and for the Ocuton S tonometer (r = 0.520, p = 0.019). No correlation was found between keratometry and IOP. The mean measurement obtained by self-tonometry (21.9 ± 3.6 mmHg) showed no statistically significant difference when compared to the mean measurement obtained by an expert operator (21.3 ± 3.4 mmHg). Conclusion: The Ocuton S tonometer is a safe instrument that can be used easily by the patient. However, in comparison to the Goldmann tonometer, it overestimates IOP and requires further technical and methodological refinements in order to ensure greater reliability."

Each subjects were subjected to simultaneous 24 hour intragastric pH and spectrophotometric bilirubin concentration monitoring (Bilitec 2000). Results: There was no difference of preprandial phase bilirubin absorbance between two groups. The absorbance of postprandial phase was significantly increased in group 2 than group 1. There was no difference between preprandial phase and postprandial phase absorbance in group 1. Postprandial phase absorbance was significantly higher in group 2. In a comparison of bile reflux with intragastric pH during night time, there were 4 types of reflux: Simultaneous increase in absorbance and pH in only 19.6%, increase in bilirubin with unchanged pH 33.3%, pH increase with unchanged absorbance 36.3%, and both unchanged in 10.8%. Linear regression analysis showed no correlation between percentage total time of pH < 4 and percentage total time of absorbance > 0.14, r = 0.068, P < 0.05. Conclusion: Because of the dietary effect, high absorbance fluids or foods should be avoided in detection. Intragastric pH and bilirubin monitoring separately predict the presence of duodenal (and/or pancreatic) reflux and bile reflux. They can not substitute for each other. The detection of DGR is improved if the two parameters are combined simultaneously."

As a basic principle, small square or circular measuring masks are randomly placed across the image and image analysis parameters are obtained for each mask. Based on learning sets, statistical classification procedures are generated which facilitate an automated classification of new data sets. Objective: To evaluate the influence of the size and shape of the measuring masks as well as the importance of feature selection, statistical procedures and technical preparation of slides on the performance of tissue counter analysis in microscopic images. As main quality measure of the final classification procedure, the percentage of elements that were correctly classified was used. Study design: H&E-stained slides of 25 primary cutaneous melanomas were evaluated by tissue counter analysis for the recognition of melanoma elements (section area occupied by tumour cells) in contrast to other tissue elements and background elements. Circular and square measuring masks, various subsets of image analysis features and classification and regression trees compared with linear discriminant analysis as statistical alternatives were used. The percentage of elements that were correctly classified by the various classification procedures was assessed. In order to evaluate the applicability to slides obtained from different laboratories, the best procedure was automatically applied in a test set of another 50 cases of primary melanoma derived from the same laboratory as the learning set and two test sets of 20 cases each derived from two different laboratories, and the measurements of melanoma area in these cases were compared with conventional assessment of vertical tumour thickness. Results: Square measuring masks were slightly superior to circular masks, and larger masks (64 or 128 pixels in diameter) were superior to smaller masks (8 to 32 pixels in diameter). As far as the subsets of image analysis features were concerned, colour features were superior to densitometric and Haralick texture features. Statistical moments of the grey level distribution were of least significance. CART (classification and regression tree) analysis turned out to be superior to linear discriminant analysis. In the best setting, 95% of melanoma tissue elements were correctly recognized. Automated measurement of melanoma area in the independent test sets yielded a correlation of r = 0.846 with vertical tumour thickness (p < 0.001), similar to the relationship reported for manual measurements. The test sets obtained from different laboratories yielded comparable results. Conclusions: Large, square measuring masks, colour features and CART analysis provide a useful setting for the automated measurement of melanoma tissue in tissue counter analysis, which can also be used for slides derived from different laboratories."

Population-based data derived from standardized questionnaires administered to healthy women aged 19-35 years in Nord-Trøndelag, Norway (n = 963), were collected in 1995-1997. Forearm BMD was assessed by single x-ray absorptiometry. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were used to determine correlates of BMD (g/cm2) and lowest quintile of BMD, respectively, at the ultradistal and distal sites. The mean age and weight of the cohort were 29.7 years (standard deviation 4.7) and 68.6 kg (standard deviation 12.5), respectively. Age and weight were positively associated with BMD at both forearm sites. When data were controlled for age and weight, later age at menarche and lack of milk consumption were associated with lower BMD values. In both linear models and logistic models, none of the factors vitamin D intake, physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption, amenorrhea, oral contraceptive use, number of pregnancies, history of breastfeeding, and family history of osteoporosis were found to be significantly associated with BMD. Prior studies have suggested that calcium supplementation in children is useful for optimizing peak BMD.

The limits of agreement for the Durnin-Womersley estimation of change in SAT were -3.4 to 2.6 kg and the SEE was 1.5 kg. The SEE for repeated measures of SAT in healthy control subjects was 0.84. Conclusions: The Durnin-Womersley formula can be used to predict change in SAT. The limits of agreement and the SEE for predicting change in SAT by MRI are approximately twice as great as the error of repeated Durnin-Womersley measures in control subjects."

Even though FCAW is well known for its good capability in producing quality welds, few reports have been published on the cause of the relatively high diffusible hydrogen content in the weld metal and its relation with the ingredients used in the wire production and with the welding parameters (mainly welding current). This paper describes experiments where data obtained from weld metal diffusible hydrogen analysis, metal droplet collection, and high-speed recording of metal droplet transfer were used to evaluate the effect of welding current on diffusible hydrogen content in the weld metal. The results from gas chromatography analysis showed that weld metal hydrogen content indeed increased with welding current. A polynomial regressional analysis concluded that hydrogen increase with current was better described by a linear function with proportional constant of approximately 0.7 or 70%. Different from the GMA welding transfer behavior, statistical analysis showed only a small increase in metal droplet size with increasing current. The metal transfer mode remained in the globular range for currents between 100 and 150 A. The most surprising findings were with the high-speed cinematography recording. Observing the high speed movies, it was possible to see that at low current, ""unmelted"" flux sporadically touched the weld pool but at higher current, the flux remained touching the weld pool during the whole time of droplet formation and transfer. It is believed that since the flux has ingredients that contain hydrogen, hydrogen passes through the arc undisturbed, going to the weld bead intact and increasing the hydrogen content in the weld metal. Another important observation is regarding to droplet size. Droplet size increased with increasing current because forces from decomposed gases from the flux could sustain the droplets, retarding their transfer and allowing them to grow."

The V̇O2 response to heavy exercise can be described by a three-exponential model with the slow phase usually commencing 2-3 min after the onset of exercise. The aim of our study was to estimate precisely the V̇O2, V̇CO2, V̇E and fC required for above-V̇O2θ exercise from the relationship of the specific variable to work-rate below V̇O2θ and to compare this with the actual value achieved. Methods: Nine cyclists performed five constant work-rates of 8 min duration, four below V̇O2θ (40, 80, 120, 160 W) and one midway between V̇O2θ and V̇O2max (295 ± 34 W). The V̇O2, V̇CO2, V̇E and fC were averaged for the final 2 min of each below-V̇O2θ test and were found to be linear with respect to work-rate (average r2 >0.95). Variables for the above-V̇O2θ work-rate were predicted by extrapolation and compared with the actual measured values at the end of the exercise bout. Results: V̇O2 exceeded the predicted value by 0.48 ± 0.21 L·min-1 (12.4 ± 5.1%), V̇CO2 by 0.78 ± 0.26 L·min-1 (23.2 ± 7.2%), V̇E by 40.3 ± 16.3 L·min-1 (51.0 ± 23.1%), and fC by 12.2 ± 12.5 beats·min-1 (8.8 ± 9.3%), all P < 0.0001 except fC P < 0.02, paired t-test. The point at which V̇O2 during above-V̇O2θ exercise exceeded the predicted value (145.7 ± 64.9 s) agreed with the point at which the slow component of V̇O2 began, as determined by nonlinear regression analysis (131.5 ± 44.3 s, P = NS.

LV transmitral early and late peak filling velocities, isovolumic relaxation time, atrial filling fraction, stress-corrected midwall shortening, and LV mass and structure were measured and adjusted for important covariates in race-specific linear regression models. Single-trait sibling correlation was strongest for early peak filling velocity. Significant cross-trait sibling correlation was detected between early and late peak filling velocities. In whites, early peak filling velocity and atrial filling fraction, and isovolumic relaxation time and end-diastolic posterior wall thickness, were also significantly correlated. Familial factors common to early and late peak filling velocities contributed to 64% and 54% of sibling resemblance in early peak filling velocity and to 76% and 77% in late peak filling velocity in blacks and whites, respectively. In whites, 100% of sibling resemblance in isovolumic relaxation time was shared by posterior wall thickness, whereas 75% of sibling influence in posterior wall thickness was common to isovolumic relaxation time. In conclusion, significant cross-trait sibling resemblance was detected between (1) early and late filling parameters and (2) isovolumic relaxation time and posterior wall thickness, suggesting pleiotropy and/or common environment on these traits.

The CM measurements can then be transformed via the model to remove any bias relative to FRM measurements. The resulting FRM-like modeled measurements may be used to provide more timely reporting of a metropolitan statistical area's (MSA's) AQI.1 Of considerable importance is the quality of the model used to relate the CM and FRM measurements. The use of a poor model could result in misleading AQI reporting in the form of incorrectly claiming either good or bad air quality. This paper describes a measure of adequacy for deciding whether a statistical linear regression model that relates FRM and continuous PM2.5 measurements is sufficient for use in AQI reporting. The approach is the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) data quality objectives (DQO) process, a seven-step strategic planning approach to determine the most appropriate data type, quality, quantity, and synthesis for a given activity.2 The chosen measure of model adequacy is r2, the square of the correlation coefficient between FRM measurements and their modeled counterparts. The paper concludes by developing regression models that meet this desired level of adequacy for the MSAs of Greensboro/Winston-Salem/High Point, NC; and Davenport/Moline/Rock Island, IA/IL. In both cases, a log transformation of the data appeared most appropriate. For the data from the Greensboro/Winston-Salem/High Point MSA, a simple linear regression model of the FRM and CM measurements had an r2 of 0.96, based on 227 paired observations. For the data from the Davenport/Moline/Rock Island MSA, due to seasonal differences between CM and FRM measurements, the simple linear regression model had to be expanded to include a temperature dependency, resulting in an r2 of 0.86, based on 214 paired observations."

The results show that the higher proportion of putative QTLs estimated to be at marker positions compared with non-marker positions is an expected consequence of the estimation methods. The study initially focused on a single interval with no QTLs and was extended to include multiple intervals and QTLs of large effect. Further, the study demonstrated that the larger proportion of estimated QTL positions at the location of markers was not unique to linear regression mapping. Maximum likelihood produced similar results, although the accumulation of positional estimates at outermost markers was reduced when regions outside the linkage group were also considered. The bias towards marker positions is greatest under the null hypothesis of no QTLs or when QTL effects are small.

However, sleeping is a dynamic process in which sleeping EE is modulated by the effect of factors such as body movement and different sleep stages. The aim of the present study was to determine a new method to improve the sleeping EE measurement by taking into account body movements during sleep. Twenty-four non-obese children participated in the present study. All subjects passed through a calibration period. HR and EE measured by IC were simultaneously collected during resting, the postprandial period, and during different levels of activity. Different methods for computing sleeping EE (resting EE × 0.90 with different breakpoints ('flex point' HR with linear regression or 'inflection point' (IP) HR with the third order polynomial regression equation (P3)) were compared with EE measured for least 2.0 h in eight sleeping children. The best method of calculation was then tested in sixteen children undergoing HR monitoring and with a body movement detector. In a subset of eight children undergoing simultaneous sleeping EE measurement by IC and HR, the use of the equation resting EE × 0.8 when HR < IP and P3 when HR > IP during the sleeping period gave the lowest difference (1 (SD 5.4) %) compared with other methods (linear or polynomial regressions). The new formula was tested in an independent subset of sixteen other children. The difference between sleeping EE computed with the formula resting EE × 0.90 and sleeping EE computed with resting EE × 0.8 when HR < IP and the P3 equation when HR > IP during sleeping periods was significant (13 (SD 5.9) %) only for active sleeping subjects (n 6 of 16 subjects).

Volunteers completed a questionnaire on exposure factors and a time-activity diary during the sample period. An unpaired t test, an analysis of variance (ANOVA), and a linear regression were performed to compare differences among cities and mean personal NO2 concentrations involving housing characteristics, as well as to determine which variables predicted the personal NO2 concentration. Sampling periods were in April, May, and June 1996 in Mexico City, Guadalajara, Cuernavaca, and Monterrey. All 122 volunteers in the study were working adults, with a mean age of 34 (SD ± 7.38); 64% were female, and the majority worked in public offices and universities. The highest NO2 concentrations were found in Mexico City (36 ppb for outdoor, 57 ppb for indoor, and 39 ppb for personal concentration) and the lowest in Monterrey (19 ppb for outdoor, 24 ppb for indoor, and 24 ppb for personal concentration). Significant differences in NO2 concentrations were found among the cities in different microenvironments. During the sampling period, volunteers spent 85% of their time indoors. The highest personal NO2 concentration was found when volunteers kept their windows closed (p = 0.03). In the regression model adjusted by city and gender, the best predictors of personal NO2 concentration were outdoor levels and time spent outdoors (R2 = 0.68).

This study was undertaken to document differences between use of AI and non-AI bulls and to develop prediction equations to compare lifetime economic merit of future progeny from alternative sire selection policies. We describe the use of two methods of measuring lifetime economic merit, with and without adjustment for opportunity cost of a postponed replacement. Comparison of lifetime relative net income adjusted for opportunity cost on groups of cows sired by different kinds of bulls showed that daughters of proven AI bulls generated $148 and $120 more lifetime net income under fluid and manufactured milk market conditions than daughters of non-AI bulls. Daughters of proven AI bulls produced $60 more than daughters of AI young sires in progeny testing programs at the time of daughter conception. We developed prediction equations from combinations of genetic evaluations for production, productive life, SCS, and linear type traits on sires to predict lifetime relative net income of progeny produced from alternative sire selection strategies. Prediction equations explained 14 to 18% of variation in relative net income (not adjusted for opportunity cost), but herd and year of first freshening accounted for considerably more variation than did genetic evaluations on the sire of the cow. Finally, two independent data sets were used to develop and test predictions of lifetime relative net income adjusted for opportunity cost using genetic evaluations based on the eight traits included in the Merit indexes for the sire of each cow. Prediction equations from odd numbered herds were used to predict lifetime economic merit in even numbered herds and vice versa. Coefficients of determination ranged from 0.088 to 0.103 and averaged 0.004 higher than prediction equations with Net or Fluid Merit. Accuracy of predictions showed that Net and Fluid Merit were robust and useful indexes that accurately identified bulls whose daughters generated highest lifetime economic merit."

Beat-to-beat blood pressure (Finapres) was monitored at rest, during conventional blood pressure measurement by a doctor, and during a mental stress test. The left ventricular mass index and diastolic function (E/A ratio) were determined by echocardiography. The systolic blood pressure response triggered by the doctor's visit (ΔSBP) correlated positively with the left ventricular mass index (r= 0.326, p<0.03) and negatively with the E/A ratio (r=-0.325, p<0.02). A positive relationship between the ΔSBP and left ventricular mass index was observed in men (r=0.556, p<0.01) but not in women. The greater ΔSBP also was associated with lower E/A ratio in women (r=-0.434, p<0.02). The ΔSBP correlated with the mental stress-induced increase in systolic blood pressure in men (r=0.586, p<0.005) but not in women (r=0.148, n.s.). Blood pressures outside the clinic were higher in men than in women (p<0.05 for systolic and p<0.005 for diastolic) despite the similar level of clinic blood pressures between the sexes.

Through these mechanisms, HGF has been shown to have an anti-atherogenic action in animal models. In atherosclerotic disorders, the circulating level of HGF has been shown to be increased to compensate for its decline in tissue. However, whether increased circulating HGF has any influence on the development of atherosclerosis has not been elucidated. In the present study, the association between plasma HGF concentration and the risk factor-carotid atherosclerosis relationship was evaluated. Three hundred and seventeen community-dwelling subjects participated in the study. The plasma concentration of HGF was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The subjects were divided into two groups according to the plasma level of HGF: a low HGF group (n=199, plasma HGF <150 pg/ml) and a high HGF group (n=118, plasma HGF ≧150 pg/ml). Risk factors for atherosclerosis were evaluated in each subject. Carotid ultrasonography was performed to measure carotid arterial intima-media thickness (IMT) and the presence of plaque. The association between carotid IMT and risk factors was then evaluated in the two HGF groups. The regression lines between age and carotid IMT were significantly different between the low HGF and high HGF groups (F[1,313]=5.98, p=0.015). The regression lines between systolic blood pressure and carotid IMT were also significantly different between the two HGF groups (F[1,313]=5.17, p=0.024). A general linear model showed that the interaction between age and plasma level of HGF was significantly associated with carotid IMT, suggesting that the plasma level of HGF modifies the age-related increase in carotid IMT. In addition, clustering of risk factors was evaluated in subjects with carotid atherosclerosis. The number of total risk factors in carotid atherosclerosis subjects with high plasma HGF was significantly greater than that in those with low HGF, even though the two groups had a similar magnitude of carotid atherosclerosis. In conclusion, these findings indicate that risk factor-dependent augmentation of carotid atherosclerosis could be influenced by circulating HGF."

Our objectives were 1) to evaluate the effects of harvest technique and sampling date on the in situ DM disappearance kinetics and nutritive value of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) forage, and 2) to compare the in situ disappearance kinetics of DM for these forages when the experimental steers were housed in confinement with those obtained from steers grazing wheat pasture. Wheat forage was harvested on three dates (March 6, March 27, and April 11, 2000). Sampling techniques evaluated on each date included three clipping techniques (whole plant, random pluck, and top half) and two evaluations of masticates (oven dried at 50°C or lyophilized). There was an interaction of harvest technique and sampling date main effects for crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), hemicellulose, cellulose, lignin, and whole-plant ash. Disappearance kinetics of DM for these 15 forages were then evaluated by the in situ technique using five 393- ± 54-kg crossbred steers consuming an alfalfa-based (Medicago sativa L.) diet in confinement, and subsequently, in five 448 ± 49-kg crossbred steers grazing wheat pasture during March 2001. For fractions A, B, and C, potential extent, rate of disappearance (Kd), and effective ruminal degradability, linear regressions of values obtained for steers grazing wheat pasture on those obtained from confined cattle had significant slopes and exhibited high r 2 statistics (>0.821). For fractions A and B, and Kd, the slope of these regression lines did not differ from unity, and the intercept did not differ from zero. For fraction C, potential extent of disappearance, and effective ruminal degradability, slopes were all equal to 1.19 and differed from unity. For effective degradability, deviation of the slope from unity can be explained, in part, on the basis of the passage rates used to calculate these values (0.035 and 0.062/h for confined and grazing steers, respectively). From a practical standpoint, the in situ disappearance kinetics of DM for these wheat forages did not appear to be altered substantially by evaluating them in grazing steers."

Knowledge that adequacy measures such as the urea reduction ratio (URR) or Kt/Vurea are being measured on haemodialysis may influence the behaviour of patients or staff such that the treatment may be better on those days. This study therefore tested the hypothesis that mean volume of blood processed (VBP), utilized as a surrogate for adequacy, is higher on adequacy measurement days than non-measurement days. Methods. Patients were identified who had been on haemodialysis over the preceding 8 months. Primary outcome was the difference in the mean VBP (in litres) on URR measurement compared with non-URR measurement days (ΔVBPU-N). Univariate and multivariate correlates of mean VBP and ΔVBPU-N were also determined. Results. Eighty-nine patients were identified who met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Linear regression demonstrated a weak relationship between VBP and URR (r = 0.24, P < 0.02). This relationship was much stronger when VBP was adjusted for patient weight (mean VBP/weight; r = 0.78, P < 0.0001). The overall mean VBP was 87.41 (± 1.2 1) and the average ΔVBPU-N was 1.1 1 (± 0.3 1) (P = 0.001). Twenty per cent of patients had a clinically relevant ΔVBPU-N of >3.6 1. Patients with a graft or fistula had a significantly higher ΔVBPU-N than patients with a tunnelled catheter. Conclusions. This study demonstrates that the average VBP is less on non-URR than on URR measurement days; this difference was clinically important in > 20% of patients. Univariate analysis indicated that the use of a fistula or graft correlated with a higher ΔVBPU-N. This implies that our current method of assessing dialysis adequacy does systematically overestimate the average delivered dose of dialysis in a subset of patients."

We performed an observational follow-up study of 295 (182 males) type 1 patients with diabetic nephropathy [mean age 37 (SE 0.7) years, mean duration of diabetes 23 (SE 0.5) years]. All patients were followed for at least 3 years, median 8 years (range 3-17), with at least three measurements of GFR using [51Cr]EDTA (median 11 measurements (range 3-32)). Two hundred and seventeen patients had the KK genotype and 78 carried the Q allele (71 KQ and 7 QQ). Results. Patients carrying the Q allele had a mean rate of decline in GFR during follow-up of 3.6 ml/min per year (SE 0.4) compared with 4.0 ml/min per year (SE 0.3) in patients with KK genotype. Other risk factors for progression of diabetic nephropathy were similar in Q carriers and KK carriers. When dividing patients in tertiles based on rate of decline in GFR, we found no difference in distribution of K121Q genotypes. No difference in the number of patients who died or reached end-stage renal disease during follow-up according to K121Q genotype were found. A multiple linear regression analysis revealed that albuminuria, mean arterial blood pressure, haemoglobin A1C and serum cholesterol during follow-up predicted a steeper decline in GFR [R2 (adjusted) = 0.27], whereas the PC-1 genotype did not contribute. Conclusions. Our study did not reveal an association between the PC-1 amino acid variant K121Q and progression of diabetic nephropathy."

Chronic allograft nephropathy is the main cause of long-term kidney graft loss. The plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) is a potential fibrogenic molecule whose secretion is regulated by several metabolic, inflammatory, and genetic factors. We aimed to determine whether PAI-1 secretion in renal transplant patients is correlated with the decline in renal function after transplantation. Methods. Renal transplant patients (145 male/71 female) were included in the study 1-27 years after transplantation (median of follow-up: 7.35 years). At inclusion, routine clinical and biological data were collected, the 4G/5G polymorphism of the recipient PAI-1 gene was determined, and the PAI-1 plasma level was measured. Results. The mean rate of decline in renal function was -4.26±0.30 ml/min/year. By multiple linear regression analysis, the rate of decline in renal function was significantly correlated with proteinuria (P=0.0176), occurrence of late acute rejection episodes (P=0.0001), and PAI-1 plasma level (P=0.0051). In addition, PAI-1 plasma level was also significantly correlated with body mass index (P=0.038), insulin (P<0.0001), platelet count (P<0.0001), and fibrinogen (P=0.024). The PAI-1 gene polymorphism tested did not influence the rate of decline in renal function after transplantation nor the plasma level of PAI.1 antigen. Conclusion. We conclude that PAI-1, whose secretion is determined in large part by metabolic and inflammatory factors, may be implicated in the rate of decline in renal function after transplantation."

Cardiopulmonary exercise study was carried out in 2 groups of hypertensives, 24 [16 men, aged 50 (SD 11) years] of whom had echocardiographic LVH and 25 [16 men, aged 41 (12)] who did not have LVH. In multiple regression analyses, the major determinants of peak oxygen uptake (VO2max) were age (-), sex (male), peak exercise systolic BP (+) and post-exercise BNP (-). For the predicted adjusted % VO2max as a measure of individualised exercise capacity, the significant predictors were the exercise-induced BNP rise (-) (p = 0.0003) and peak exercise systolic BP (+) (p = 0.001). In other words, subjects with greater myocardial dysfunction had a greater rise in BNP during exercise. LVH did not however relate to exercise capacity. The baseline, post-exercise and the % rise in BNP (pmol/L) with exercise were not statistically different in those with LVH compared with those without (median values of 11.2, 14.6 and 133% versus 10.6, 11.5 and 120% respectively). Similarly, there were no significant differences in exercise capacity between the groups: exercise time, oxygen uptakes at ventilatory threshold and at peak exercise (VO2max) were 10.8 (2.5) min, 15.8 (4.6) and 33.6 (7.6) ml/min/kg in the LVH group against 11.4 (2.9) min, 18.6 (5.2) and 36 (11.1) ml/min/kg in the non-LVH group respectively. The estimated VO2max was not different from that predicted from age, sex, weight and height in either group suggesting preserved exercise capacity in these subjects as a whole. In Conclusion, BNP may potentially act as a homeostatic mechanism that helps to limit exercise incapacity in hypertension irrespective of LVH."

Patients and methods: We compared patient and tumor characteristics of 16 LTPFS with the characteristics of 118 MBC patients who received HDCT with ASCT at our institution between 1992 and 2000. To estimate the cumulative dose of chemotherapy received, the summation dose intensity product (SDIP) of the different chemotherapy regimens was calculated as recently described by Hryniuk et al. The SDIP of the induction regimens was added to that of the HDCT regimens to yield the total SDIP of the chemotherapy received. Multivariate analysis was performed to describe the influence of the total SDIP and other prognostic factors on progression-free survival (PFS). Results: LTPFS were mostly ≥50 years of age and had limited, chemotherapy-sensitive, hormone-responsive MBC. Due to an apparent dose-survival relationship, an increase by 10 units (U) in the SDIP increased the PFS time by 3 months. Independent predictors of an improved PFS were positive estrogen receptors (P = 0.001), positive combined hormone receptors (P = 0.020), and a complete remission/no evidence of disease status after HDCT (P<0.001). In patients who had a disease-free interval (DFI) >24 months after primary surgery, an SDIP of >55 U was independently associated with a longer PFS [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.73; 95% confidence interval 1.29-5.81; P = 0.009]. Conclusion: HDCT can achieve long-term PFS in young MBC patients with limited, hormone-responsive and chemotherapy-sensitive disease. After a DFI>24 months, a longer PFS is associated with a higher chemotherapy dose as measured by SDIP. These retrospective analyses suggest SDIP might be a tool for studying cumulative dose as a determinant of outcome of MBC chemotherapy. Thus far, however, we cannot clearly identify any subgroup of MBC patients in whom HDCT with ASCT is of particular benefit. © 2002 Oxford University Press."

However, the statistical character of the distribution leads to an uncertainty in the parameters evaluated from a limited number of experiments. This study is concerned with the analysis of the methods of estimation as well as sample size on the estimates of the Weibull parameters. The maximum likelihood method, moments method, and linear regression method were studied. Monte Carlo simulations were carried out in order to assess the influence of the number of specimens tested on the Weibull parameters calculated by the different methods. The number of specimens tested displayed a large influence upon the calculated Weibull modulus. By applying weighing factors to the linear regression method, the standard deviation of Weibull parameters decreased significantly. As a compromise between minimizing both the dispersion of the evaluation method and the experimental effort, the use is suggested of the linear regression method with a minimum number of 20 specimens in a nonweighted analysis and 10 in a weighted analysis."

Recording of clinical episodes began at first parturition for 1704 Holstein cows (in six Pennsylvania herds and one Nebraska herd) and continued into second lactation for 1055 of these cows. A total of 456 cows (sired by 168 bulls) had at least one clinical episode during first lactation, and 230 cows (sired by 100 bulls) had at least one clinical episode during second lactation. A severity code from 1 (normal milk) to 5 (acute systemic mastitis) was assigned daily (for up to 30 d after detection) to all quarters that had clinical mastitis. Only the severity codes for the first clinical episode to occur during first and second lactation are considered here. The initial and maximum severity codes, as well as the natural logarithms of both the sum of severity codes that were above normal (> 1) and the total days severity codes were above normal were regressed on herd (a classification variable), age at first calving, days in milk at clinical detection, and sire transmitting abilities taken one at a time. Linear and nonlinear effects were estimated for sire transmitting abilities. Separate analyses were conducted on dependent variables that considered severity and duration of clinical mastitis from: all organisms, coagulase-negative staphylococci, coliform species, streptococci other than Streptococcus agalactiae, and the most common environmental organisms (coliform species and streptococci other than Streptococcus agalactiae). Daughters of sires that transmit the lowest somatic cell score had the least severe and shortest clinical episodes from environmental organisms during first lactation. Selection for lower somatic cell score may reduce the severity and duration of clinical episodes from environmental organisms during first lactation."

Reliance on full breastfeeding alone for a longer time could have deleterious nutritional and health implications at later stages of children's lives. About 47% of children are weaned at age ≥6 months and more than 50% of children in India under 4 years are stunted. We investigated the association between timing of weaning and stunting of children in India, using the data from National Family Health Survey, 1992-1993. Methods. Logistic analyses were employed on pooled data comprising one state each from six regions of India (N = 6285) with height status of children age 2-4 years as the dependent variable. Timing of weaning was considered as the main control variable in the regression models. Results. Children weaned at age 6 months (odds ratio [OR] = 1.57) and after 6 months (OR = 1.88) were more likely to be stunted at later age compared with those weaned before 6 months (P < 0.001). Stunting appeared to be considerably lower for children weaned at age 3 months and showed an upward trend thereafter. The effect of age at weaning on stunting attenuated but persisted with statistical significance after controlling for important demographic, health, social and region variables. The likelihood of stunting was 77% for children weaned at age >6 months who had not received full immunization in the first year and had lived in poor conditions. Conclusions. Timing of weaning is significantly associated with stunting among children in India. The underlying causal associations between weaning behaviour and growth retardation need to be further examined by using longitudinal data."

The mean cervical length decreased from 37 ± 12mm at first measurement to 34 ± 11 mm at the second one. A linear regression model was found between the time interval of the first (R = 0.656, p < 0.001) and the second (R = 0.435, p < 0.001) assessments and the week of delivery. The current data confirm that the length of the preserved segment of the cervix is an important indicator of its competence.

Annual negative fluxes were found for H+, NO3-, SO4- and Cl- and annual positive fluxes for Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, HCO3-, PO43- and DOC. Negative fluxes for most of these ions have been reported previously but this is the first time that they have all been measured at the same time in one forest. The relative importance of atmospheric deposition and canopy leaching to net below canopy fluxes was evaluated using two approaches previously employed in this type of study. The first approach consisted of calculating total inputs, taking inputs as bulk precipitation or bulk precipitation plus the additional input from scavenging dry deposition by vegetation surfaces, corrected by the maximum and minimum leaching rate. The values obtained for inputs were very similar, possibly due to the minimum effect on scavenging particles by the canopy. In the second approach, linear regressions were developed for net below canopy fluxes and the variables related to dry deposition (antecedent dry period) and leaching (event quantity and duration, etc.); this showed that NO3- in net below canopy fluxes came from dry deposition, the rest of the elements from leaching, and SO42- from both. Similar results were obtained using both approaches. It was found that a simple linear regression model with event quantity as the independent variable can readily substitute the Lovett and Lindberg (1984) [J. Appl. Ecol. 21 (1984) 1013] model. The latter model was applied for separate internal and external sources in the case of SO42-. This forest differed greatly from other, previously studied forests. Large amounts of water were required for a positive flux (leaching), suggesting that the negative net below canopy fluxes of some elements were due to the low water regimes during the study year. Possible causes of this were the high value of the canopy saturation and the pattern of scattered rainfall, which led to extreme values of interception losses. The point at which the line representing the relationship between net below canopy fluxes and event quantity intersected the x axis varied depending on the leachable properties of the canopy ions. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

As few drill cores were available in the KTB Hauptbohrung, most of the petrophysical and geochemical data are based on drill cuttings investigations. We present an analysis of drill cuttings data, addressing the question of what relationship between cataclastic shear-zones and petrophysical and geochemical data can be revealed. For that purpose we developed a regression model with the amount of cataclastic rocks in drill cuttings as a dependent variable and the petrophysical and geochemical variables as regressors. We use depth related data from two sections of the KTB Hauptbohrung with cataclastic shear-zones in gneiss (1738-2380 m) and in metabasite (4524-4908 m). The variables are selected by estimating and testing a linear regression model taking into account the autocorrelation of the data due to the depth structure. The variables which characterize the cataclastic shear-zones in gneiss according to our model are the contents of carbon and crystal water and the thermal conductivity, each with positive coefficients. This model explains, in total, 57 per cent of the variance of the observed data. For cataclastic shear-zones in metabasite the content of crystal water and the magnetic susceptibility with positive coefficients and the content of chromium with a negative coefficient are the significant variables. The explained variance in this model is 60 per cent. Being significant in both lithologies, the content of crystal water is an important variable for cataclastic shearzones. The prediction of shear zones is feasible by our methods, but the results of our study should be confirmed and widened by investigations of other data sets."

Animals - 6 male Beagles that were 2 to 6 years old. Procedure - Dogs were used in a crossover design with at least a 5-day washout period between treatments. Each dog received morphine, saline (0.9% NaCl) solution, and oxytocin via the IV and IT routes of administration; however, only results for morphine and saline treatments were reported here. Dogs were anesthetized and prepared for noninvasive dental dolorimetry. After IV or IT administration, electrical stimulation was applied to a tooth, and REMPs of the digastricus muscle were recorded at 5-minute intervals for 60 minutes. To determine differences in REMP amplitude between treatments, a linear regression line was fitted for each dog-treatment combination. Results - The IV administration of morphine significantly inhibited REMP amplitude, compared with IV administration of saline solution. Intrathecal administration of morphine significantly inhibited REMP amplitude, compared with IT administration of saline solution. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance - Noninvasive dental dolorimetry in anesthetized dogs has promise as a technique for use in evaluating the analgesic potential of drugs administered IV and IT through evaluation of their effect on REMP amplitude recorded for the digastricus muscle."

Mukai estimated a large rate of early linear decay for the relative viability of Drosophila melanogaster chromosome II (ΔMII = 0.004).

We show that, from the perspective of the whole long-term experiment, it is hard to decide up to which generation viability can be considered to decline linearly. Depending on this decision, and on whether or not the regression is forced through the origin, very different estimates are obtained. Furthermore, the particular behaviour of the lines used as control suggests that they could have been different from the remaining lines at the beginning of the experiment, and casts doubts on the adequacy of a forced regression. Estimates from the linear unforced regression (ΔMII = 0.011) or from the linear term in a quadratic unforced regression (ΑMII - 0.001) are very different.

Pretreatment with 2,3-dinor-15-F2t-IsoP and 2,3-dinor-5,6-dihydro-15-F2t-IsoP induced no alteration of 15-F2t-IsoP concentration-response curves. In contrast, 15-keto-15-F2t-IsoP pretreatment competitively inhibited the response to 15-F2t-IsoP. When concentration ratios of EC50 values were used, a Schild regression of this data was linear with a slope of 0.974 and a pA2 value of 6.13. 15-keto-15-F2t-IsoP at high concentrations caused a weak concentration-dependent relaxation of rat aorta rings contracted with U46619 (3.10-8 M) that was not modified in the absence of endothelium. In contrast, 2,3-dinor-15-F2t-IsoP and 2,3-dinor-5,6-dihydro-15-F2t-IsoP induced no vasodilation. In conclusion, among the F2-isoprostane metabolites, 2,3-dinor-15-F2t-IsoP and 2,3-dinor-5,6-dihydro-15-F2t-IsoP did not cause vasorelaxation or vasoconstriction on the rat thoracic aorta. In contrast, 15-keto-15-F2t-IsoP mediates contraction through activation of TP-receptors, probably as a partial agonist, and induces a weak endothelium-independent relaxation at high concentrations."

Eight different PoO mixtures, namely, PoO:PKO, PoO:CoO, PoO:PS, PoO:PO, PoO:CaO, PoO:OeO, PoO:CnO and PoO:SFO were prepared at different ratios (w/w) to give various IV (PKO represents palm kernel olein; CoO, coconut oil; PS, palm stearin; PO, palm oil; CaO, canola oil; OeO, olive oil; CnO, corn oil; and SFO, sunflower oil). Each sample was then scanned from 80 to -100°C at -5°C/min using a DSC. All the mixtures showed two exothermic peaks in their cooling thermograms, except PoO:SFO mixtures which showed three peaks. Results of stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) analysis showed that five independent variables extracted from each of these peaks, namely, on-set temperature, off-set temperature, peak temperature, peak height and peak enthalpy could predict well the IV of each mixture. The calibration models developed showed appreciable effectiveness, reproducibility and accuracy, and specificity towards the calibration data set. A shared calibration model for each group of PoO mixtures i.e. high-lauric (PoO:PKO and PoO:CoO), high-palmitic (PoO:PS and PoO:PO) and high-oleic (PoO:CaO and PoO:OeO) mixtures was also developed. SMLR analysis showed that the shared models were also capable in predicting IV of the PoO mixtures, even though the coefficient of determination, R2, was slightly lower than that of their individual models. The shared calibration models also had good reproducibility and accuracy when compared with the standard chemical method. In conclusion, DSC provides an effective method in determining IV for routine analysis in the industries, whereby one single model could be calibrated for the use of all oil and fat products that have similar chemical compositions such as high-lauric, high-palmitic or high-oleic mixtures in the industry."

We studied a number of factors, including ritonavir plasma levels, and their capability of predicting response to therapy with ritonavir (RTV). Methods. Eleven HIV-positive children, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-experienced, protease inhibitor (PI) naive, receiving RTV in combination with two NRTIs were enrolled in the study. Demographic parameters were: median age (range) 10 (2-13) years, weight 26 (10-38) kg, body surface area (BSA) 0.93 (0.47-1.21) m2. Baseline values of CD4, percent CD4 and viral load were 137 (2-1390) cells/μL, 9.5 (0.4-32.4)%, and 5.15 (4.30-6.18) log10 copies/mL, respectively. The dose of RTV was 318 (266-409) mg/m2 twice daily. Peak (3.5 h after administration) and trough (predose) plasma concentrations of RTV were determined on one occasion at steady-state after a morning dose. Virological response to treatment was quantified as the difference between the baseline value of viral load and the value observed at 6 months of therapy (Δ6). Results. The relationship between Δ6 and demographic parameters (age, weight, BSA, and baseline CD4, percent CD4, and viral load) and plasma concentrations of RTV was studied by linear regression. Median (range) Δ6 was 0.88 (0.77-2.62) log10 copies/mL. Peak and trough of RTV were 14.9 (3.2-31.4) and 5.0 (0.1-15.6) mg/L, respectively. Trough concentration of RTV was the best predictor of Δ6, although the relationship between these two variables was not statistically significant (r = 0.56, P = 0.075). Conclusion. Our observation of a trend for a greater decrease in viral load in patients with higher trough concentration of RTV warrants further pharmacodynamic studies of PI in paediatric patients."

Data on the spatial distribution of seabirds at sea is commonly used in risk assessments of the possible impact of oil spills. The validity of such assessments depends on the stability of the observed spatial pattern through time. In this study we explored the year-to-year predictability in the spatial distribution of guillemots (Uria spp.) from a 9-year data set covering an area of approximately 1000 × 600 km2 in the Barents Sea from late January to early March. 2. Spatial correlograms were used to elucidate the strength and scale of the spatial patterns within years, and the concordance of these patterns between years. Broad-scale oceanographic features were used in linear regressions to model the spatial pattern in guillemot distribution for each year. The ability of these models to predict their spatial distribution in other years was then evaluated. 3. The analyses revealed two nested levels of patchiness. The large-scale pattern, with a characteristic scale of 300 km, had a weak (R2 = 0.06) but significant spatial predictability between years. The predictability increased marginally when the data set was divided into two time periods (R2 equal to 0.07 and 0.17, respectively). Nested within the large-scale pattern, the analyses revealed a small-scale level of patchiness with no significant spatial year-to-year predictability. 4. The broad-scale oceanographic variables could explain from 14% to 42% of the variance in the spatial distribution of guillemots within each year. The models were on average significantly better than using a random model when predicting other years. We found no relationships between the fit of the models and the ability to predict guillemot distribution in other years. There was a large variation in the parameter estimates between years, resulting in a large range in predicted values. 5. This study illustrates some of the difficulties associated with predicting the spatial distribution of mobile and patchy organisms. Our results indicate that the use of restricted survey data in extrapolating and predicting the distribution of seabirds may be misleading. Restricted survey data should mainly be used to identify vulnerable populations on a regional scale. Only when larger data series are available is it possible to evaluate, quantify and model the predictable spatial pattern in more detailed assessment analyses. There is a need to develop methods that quantify how unpredictable patchiness may affect the vulnerability of populations to surface pollutants and other environmental disturbances."

A comparison was made between the ICP values measured simultaneously in the parenchyma of the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum. In order to obtain a wide range of ICP, animals were subjected to a severe closed head injury (CHI), a moderate CHI or to a sham operation. ICP values ranged from 0.8 to 43.9 mmHg. After 15 min stabilisation the first measurement was taken and followed by a second measurement 25 min after onset to allow comparison of ICP changes at the two implantation sites. Linear regression analysis showed a highly significant correlation at 15 min: Y=0.919X+0.655 (R2=0.977), and at 25 min: Y=0.931X+0.698 (R2=0.976). The differences in ICP measurement between cerebellar and cerebral site were not significantly different from zero at both time points. Altman-Bland plots showed that the difference in ICP readings between the two locations could differ maximally by 5.3 mmHg. The largest differences were detected when high ICP values were recorded. We conclude that in rats the ICP measurement in the cerebellum is comparable to the ICP measurement in the cerebral cortex. The cerebellar ICP can be used as a valuable alternative during experimental procedures. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."

This raises questions about the suitability of the canine heart as a model for preservation research and the PRSW relationship as an end-point. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the PRSW relationship as an index of left ventricular contractility in porcine cardiac allografts. Methods: Eighteen orthotopic heart transplants were performed in inbred Westran pigs. Brain death was induced in the donor pigs 1 h prior to explantation. The donor hearts were arrested with extracellular cardioplegia, which was stored in ice prior to administration. On explantation, the donor hearts were immersed in cardioplegia and stored in ice. The donor hearts were subjected to either 4 (IT4, n=6), 6 (IT6, n=9) or 14 (IT14, n=3) h of ischaemia. Post-transplant, all hearts were supported with dobutamine (10 mcg/kg per min). The PRSW relationship was derived from pressure-volume loops obtained by epicardial sonomicrometry and transmyocardial micromanometry. Multiple linear regression was used to describe and compare the PRSW relationship before brain death in the donor and after weaning from bypass in the recipient. Results: Eleven hearts were weaned successfully from cardiopulmonary bypass: IT4 100% (6/6), IT6 56% (5/9) and IT14 0% (0/3) (IT4 versus IT14: P=0.012). Analysis of the PRSW relationship revealed a reduction in contractility in both the IT4 and IT6 groups (both P<0.0001), but a greater reduction in the IT6 group (P<0.0001). Notably, the volume-axis intercept of the PRSW relationship was found to be a better discriminator of post-preservation contractile dysfunction than the slope of the PRSW relationship. Conclusions: The porcine heart's susceptibility to ischaemic injury makes it ideal for evaluating the effect of different preservation strategies on contractile recovery. The PRSW relationship can be used to evaluate the differences in contractile recovery, though the nature of the effect of ischaemic preservation necessitates analysis by multiple linear regression. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This study explored the association between biomarkers of type I collagen metabolism and exposure to physical workload. Methods. In a prospective cohort study, serum concentrations of markers of type I collagen synthesis and degradation were assessed monthly for student nurses who worked as nurses for a period of 6 months and compared with those of a reference group. The number of patient-handling activities was estimated from observations at the workplace. Linear generalized estimating equations were used to analyze differences in the serum concentrations of the biomarkers between the exposed group and reference group, as well as to analyze whether the number of patient-handling activities was associated with serum concentrations of the biomarkers. Results. Serum concentrations of the biomarkers were found to differ between the groups. The biomarkers reflected a higher anabolism of type I collagen in the exposed group when compared with that of the reference group. An analysis of the effect of the number of patient-handling activities revealed that a higher exposure was associated with higher effective type I collagen synthesis within the exposed group. Conclusions. These results indicate that serum concentrations of these biomarkers of type I collagen metabolism can reflect differences in exposure between contrasting groups, and also varying levels of exposure between persons within an occupation."

Therefore, we aimed to define a pharmacokinetic model that accurately predicts fentanyl concentrations before, during, and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Methods: Parameters for two-compartment and three-compartment models were estimated by applying population pharmacokinetic modelling to fentanyl concentration vs time data measured in 29 patients undergoing elective, primary CABG. The ability of these models to predict fentanyl concentrations in a second series of ten patients undergoing CABG was then assessed. Results: A simple, three-compartment model had excellent predictive ability, with a median prediction error (PE = ([Fentanyl]meas - [Fentanyl]pred)/[Fentanyl]pred ·100%) of -0.5%, and a median absolute PE (APE = PE) of 14.0%. In comparison to the two-compartment models, linear regression of measured:predicted concentration ratios indicated that the three-compartment model was free of systematic and time-related changes in bias (P < 0.05). The parameters of this three-compartment model are: V1 15.01, V2 20.0 I, V3 86.1 1, Cl1 1.08 L·min-1, Cl2 4.90 L·min-1, and Cl3 2.60 L·min-1. Conclusions: Our pharmacokinetic model provides a rational foundation for designing fentanyl dose regimens for patients undergoing CABG. When combined with previously published information regarding intraoperative fentanyl pharmacodynamics, dose regimens that reliably achieve and maintain desired fentanyl concentrations throughout the intraoperative period can be designed to achieve specific therapeutic goals."

Models included fixed effects of herd-test day and breed composition - age at calving - season of calving by days in milk, and random regressions with Legendre polynomials of order four for animal genetic and permanent environmental effects. Milk yields in different countries were defined as genetically different traits for the purpose of multiple-trait model. Estimated breeding values of bulls and cows from single- and multiple-trait models were compared within and across countries for two traits: total milk yield in lactation and lactation persistency, defined as the linear coefficient of animal genetic curve. Correlations between single- and multiple-trait evaluations within country for total yield were higher than 0.95 for bulls and close to 1 for cows. Correlations for lactation persistency were lower than respective correlations for total yield. Between country correlations for lactation yield ranged from 0.93 to 0.96, indicating different ranking of bulls on different country scales under multiple-trait model. Lactation persistency had in general lower between-country correlations, with the highest values for Canada-Italy and Australia-New Zealand pairs, for both single- and multiple-country models. Although multiple-country random regression test-day model was computationally feasible for four countries, the same would not be true for routine international genetic evaluation in the near future."

Previous studies suggest that alcohol exposure may be linked to impaired pulmonary function through oxidant-antioxidant mechanisms. Alcohol may be an important source of oxidants; however, wine contains several antioxidants. In this study we analyzed the relation of beverage specific alcohol intake with forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) in a random sample of 1555 residents of Western New York, USA. Methods: We expressed pulmonary function as percent of predicted normal FEV1 (FEV1%) and FVC (FVC%) after adjustment for height, age, gender and race. To obtain information on alcohol intake we used a questionnaire that reliably queries total alcohol and beverage specific recent (past 30 days) and lifetime alcohol consumption. Results: Using multiple linear regression analysis after adjustment for covariates (pack-years of smoking, weight, smoking status, education, nutritional factors and for FEV1%, in addition, eosinophil count), we observed no significant correlation between total alcohol intake and lung function. However, we found positive associations of recent and lifetime wine intake with FEV1% and FVC%. When we analyzed white and red wine intake separately, the association of lung function with red wine was weaker than for white wine. Conclusion: While total alcohol intake was not related to lung function, wine intake showed a positive association with lung function. Although we cannot exclude residual confounding by healthier lifestyle in wine drinkers, differential effects of alcoholic beverages on lung health may exist. © 2002 Schünemann et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

In ecologic studies, group-level rather than individual-level exposure data are used. When using group-level exposure data, established by sufficiently large samples of individual exposure assessments, the bias of the effect estimate due to sampling errors or random assessment errors at the individual-level is generally negligible. In contrast, systematic assessment errors may produce more pronounced errors in the group-level exposure measures, leading to bias in ecologic analyses. Methods. We focus on effects of systematic exposure assessment errors in partially ecologic case-control studies. Individual-level information on disease status, group membership, and covariates is obtained from registries, whereas the exposure is a group-level measure obtained from an established exposure database. Effects on bias and coverage of 95% CI in various error situations are investigated under the linear risk model, using both simulated and empirical ecologic data on exposures that are binary at the individual level. Results. Our simulations suggest that the bias produced by systematic exposure assessment errors under the linear risk model is generally approximately equal to the ratio of the slope bias and the intercept bias in ordinary linear regression with measurement errors in the independent variable. Consequently, bias in either: direction can occur. Exposure assessment errors that systematically distort the group-level exposure measures have more pronounced effects on bias and coverage than errors producing random fluctuations of the group-level measures, which imply bias towards the null. Conclusions. The results indicate the need for careful consideration of potential effects of systematic distortions of the group-level exposure measures when constructing and applying group-level exposure databases, such as probabilistic job exposure matrices."

Material and methods - We examined muscle tissue from seven IBM patients and controls by immunocytochemistry using antibodies against Bcl-2, Fas (a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family) and the regeneration marker, neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM). We also investigated the occurrence of DNA fragmentation by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) nick end labeling (TUNEL)-method. Results -Both Bcl-2 and Fas were up-regulated in muscle fibers in IBM and disease controls. Bcl-2 was expressed by regenerating muscle fibers while Fas was expressed by non-regenerating muscle fibers associated with inflammatory cell infiltrates. Bcl-2 and Fas were also expressed by inflammatory cells. There were scattered TUNEL positive nuclei and most of these appeared to be inflammatory cells. Conclusion - The low occurrence of apoptotic myonuclei is not related to Bcl-2 expression, which is confined to regenerating muscle cells in IBM and other myopathies."

Methods: From German rotogravure printing plants 278 male workers, mean age 39.8 years, mean duration of employment 14.9 years, were examined. A mean lifetime weighted average exposure (LWAE) of 45.1 ppm toluene in ambient air was found for 154 exposed workers (rotogravure printing area), with a mean current exposure of 24.7 ppm. The corresponding data for a second group of 124 workers with very low exposure (endprocessing area) had LWAE of 9.3 ppm and a current exposure of 3.3 ppm toluene. Psychomotor performance (steadiness, line tracing, aiming, tapping, and peg board) and subjective symptoms were examined. Results: No significant differences between the two exposure groups were found by analysis of variance (ANOVA). By stepwise linear regression analyses there were weak associations of LWAE with one performance variable and two symptoms scales, but the results were not significant after correction for the α error. Psychomotor performance was mostly affected by age (maximum explained variance up to 13%), and handedness (up to 9%), whereas subjective symptoms are mostly affected by anxiety (up to 38%). Conclusions: The weak associations between long term exposure to toluene should be used to indicate further longitudinal investigations. The results of this cross sectional study show no obvious dose response relation for psychomotor functions and subjective symptoms among workers exposed to toluene at a current exposure level of 1-88 ppm."

Subjects and Methods: The methodology included the distribution of a self-administered questionnaire, which was completed by the parents of 1482 schoolboys who satisfied the selection criteria of the study. Results: The prevalence rate of questionnaire-diagnosed asthma (QDA) was 9.5%. The prevalence rate of a positive HHEV among QDA boys (QDAs) was 65.0%. Positive HHEV among QDAs was associated significantly with those who were younger (P<0.0001), with decreasing levels of socioeconomic class (P<0.0001), histories of pets at home (P<0.0001), presence of a currently smoking family member (P<0.0001), and/or a smoking father (P<0.0001), with mean period of school absenteeism (P<0.0001), and previous admission to hospital (P<0.05).

There was no difference in any anthropometric variable between HIV-infected and uninfected women. However, women with viral loads (genome equivalents/mL) between 4 and 5 and >5log10 had 1.1 [95% confidence interval (Cl): -0.3, 2.3] and 2.5 (95% Cl: 0.1, 5.1) kg lower weights compared with uninfected women; this was explained by losses of both AFA and AMA. Malaria parasitemia was associated with 6 cm2 (95% Cl: 0.4; 11.8) or 25% lower AMA. Elevated serum ACT was a negative predictor of all anthropometric variables, i.e., levels between 0.3 and 0.4, 0.4 and 0.5 and >0.5 g/L were associated with 1, 2 and 6 kg lower mean body weights, respectively. Despite the limitations of a cross-sectional design, we conclude that arm fat and muscle areas, reflecting body fat and lean body mass, seem to be unaffected in the majority of HIV-infected pregnant women, but decline with increasing viral loads. The effects of viral load are not explained by elevated serum ACT, which is a strong independent predictor of all anthropometric variables."

Thirty-nine aliquots of simulator solution with a VAC target value of 0.079 ± 0.010 g/210 L were stored and analyzed independently monthly at two locations: The University of Oklahoma HSC Toxicology Laboratories (OUHSC) and Oklahoma Department of Public Safety Alcohol and Drugs Countermeasures Unit (DPS/ADCU). Paired Intoxilyzer 5000 Evidential Breath-Alcohol Analyzers + Guth Breath Test Simulators were used to measure 20 consecutive VACs generated at 34°C with individual simulator solution aliquots, followed by VAC control tests in triplicate. Control tests at OUHSC were carried out with a NIST-traceable compressed ethanol/nitrogen gas mixture with a validated label ethanol concentration of 0.085 g/210 L ± 2% at 760 torr. Control tests at DPS/ADCU were carried out with simulator-generated vapor-alcohol samples with a validated VAC of 0.10 ± 0.01 g/210 L. The measurement results were analyzed by standard statistical methods with a STATGRAPHICS Plus for Windows Version 6.0 microcomputer statistics program. No significant changes occurred during the one-year study period in the concentration of the aqueous simulator alcohol solution, as reflected by close agreement of the mean results of each set of 20 consecutive VAC analyses. The summary descriptive statistics for the VAC measurements were OUHSC (4°C) mean ± SD = 0.077 ± 0.0004 g/210 L, median = 0.077, mode = 0.077, span = 0.075-0.079; DPS/ADCU (4°C) mean ± SD = 0.079 ± 0.0013 g/210 L, median 0.079, mode = 0.078, span = 0.077-0.081; DPS/ADCU (Room Temp.) mean ± SD = 0.078 ± 0.0011 g/210 L, median = 0.078, mode = 0.078, span = 0.076-0.080. All OUHSC and DPS/ADCU VAC control tests were within acceptable target value ranges. The least squares linear regression model equations for y (= VAC, g/210) upon x (= time in months) were OUHSC (4°C) y = 0.077 - 0.000021 x, DPS/ADCU (4°C) y = 0.079 + 0.000032x; and DPS/ADCU (Room Temp.) y = 0.078 + 0.000038x. The essentially zero slopes for all 3 models signify that no significant change occurred in the alcohol concentrations of all 39 simulator solutions aliquots measured over the 1-year study period, for either 4°C or room temperature storage. The Pearson correlation coefficients for the above three regression models were R = -0.20, 0.10, and 0.13, respectively; each value is close to zero, confirming the absence of significant statistical relationship between VACs and passage of time.

These statistics indicate that the fitted models explain only 1 to 4% of the small total variability in the VAC as a function of time. ANOVA statistics for each of the three sets of VAC test results yield a P-value greater than 0.10, indicating that there is not a statistically significant relationship between VAC and the passage of time, at a 90% or higher confidence level. We conclude that the ethanol concentration of simulator alcohol solutions stored in sealed polyethylene bottles, at either 4°C or normal room temperature, does not change significantly for at least one year after preparation, and that a correct initial VAC target value will remain valid during that time period."

Through the years, researchers have used different kinds of fundamental and simulative test methods to estimate the rutting performance of HMA. It has been recognized that most fundamental tests are very complex and simulative tests are generally easy to perform. A comparative study of two fundamental tests [repeated shear at constant height (RSCH) and repeated load confined creep (RLCC) tests] and one simulative test [asphalt pavement analyzer (APA) rut test] is documented. A comparison and correlation of various parameters (permanent deformation or strain, slopes, and intercepts from linear or power law regressions) from these three test results were conducted. The analysis data indicated that the two fundamental tests had significant correlation with APA rut tests. The relationship between the deformation rates and the correlation between initial deformation from the RSCH and RLCC indicate similar deformation behavior of HMAs under RSCH and APA loading conditions. Based on the observed relationships and the existing guidelines for interpreting RSCH permanent shear strain and RLCC permanent strain, preliminary guidelines were recommended for evaluating rut resistance on the basis of APA rut depth. Compared with the existing APA criteria developed by the Georgia Department of Transportation, the acceptable rut depth criteria generated from this study are reasonable and applicable."

Some published data suggest that the use of these agents is associated with impaired cerebral blood flow/carbon dioxide (CO2) reactivity. Cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity was therefore measured in three cohorts of adult merino sheep: awake (n=6), anaesthetized with steady-state propofol (15 mg/min; n=6) and anaesthetized with 2% isoflurane (n=6). Changes in cerebral blood flow were measured continuously from changes in velocities of blood in the sagittal sinus via a Doppler probe. Alterations in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (PaCO2) over the range 18-63 mmHg were achieved by altering either the inspired CO2 concentration or the rate of mechanical ventilation. Cerebral blood flow/CO2 relationships were determined by linear regression analysis, with changes in cerebral blood flow expressed as a percentage of the value for a PaCO2 of 35 mmHg. Propofol decreased cerebral blood flow by 55% relative to pre-anaesthesia values (P=0.0001), while isoflurane did not significantly alter cerebral blood flow (88.45% of baseline, P=0.39). Significant linear relationships between cerebral blood flow and CO2 tension were determined in all individual studies (r2 ranged from 0.72 to 0.99). The slopes of the lines were highly variable between individuals for the awake cohort (mean 4.73, 1.42-7. 12, 95% C1). The slopes for the propofol (mean 2.67, 2.06-3.28, 95% C1) and isoflurane (mean 2.82, 2.19-3.45, 95% CI) cohorts were more predictable. However, there was no significant difference between these anaesthetic agents with respect to the CO2 reactivity of cerebral blood flow."

Patients where epilepsy was a syndrome, either as an underlying or contributing cause-of-death at any time of life, throughout Sweden during 1975-1995 were included. All conditions mentioned on each death certificate were examined, and epilepsy and injury diagnoses were separated according to underlying, contributing or multiple cause-of-death. Annual mortality rates, case-fatality rates, and linear regression coefficients were computed. The most common underlying cause-of-death (UCD) was diseases of the circulatory system (34.4%) followed by epilepsy (31.7%). Injury and poisoning were coded as UCDs for 5.8% of the patients. Injury and poisoning as a contributory cause-of-death increased significantly, but not as an underlying cause during the study period. The proportion of each diagnostic group as an underlying cause decreased by 35% for epilepsy and 18% for injury from 1981 and onwards. These changes should be interpreted with caution since changes of coding practice are more likely to be the cause of these apparent changes. The most frequent specific external causes of injury deaths in epileptic patients were falls and drowning. Intracranial fatal injuries in connection with fall accidents predominated, especially among elderly persons. Deaths related to accidental poisoning were caused by the toxic effect of non-medicinal substances.

Linkage mapping is appropriate for low resolution mapping to localise trait loci to broad chromosome regions within a few cM (< 10 cM), and is based on family data. Linkage disequilibrium mapping, on the other hand, is useful in high resolution or fine mapping, and is based on both population and family data. Using only one marker, one may carry out single-point linkage analysis and linkage disequilibrium mapping. Using two or more markers, it is possible to flank the QTL by multipoint analysis. The development and thus availability of dense marker maps, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in human genome, presents a tremendous opportunity for multipoint fine mapping. In this article, we propose a regression approach of mapping QTL by linkage disequilibrium mapping based on population data. Assuming that two marker loci flank one quantitative trait locus, a two-point linear regression is proposed to analyse population data. We derive analytical formulas of parameter estimations, and non-centrality parameters of appropriate tests of genetic effects and linkage disequilibrium coefficients. The merit of the method is shown by the power calculation and comparison. The two-point regression model can capture much more linkage and linkage disequilibrium information than that derived when only one marker is used. For a complex disease with heritability h2≥0.15, a study with sample size of 250 can provide high power for QTL detection under moderate linkage disequilibria."

The levels of cardiovascular disease risk factors were adjusted for age, gender, smoking and alcohol drinking. Heritability was estimated from the slope of the line linear regression of offspring on mid-parent. All risk factors showed positive familial correlations, and correlations were generally lower for spouses than for parent-offspring pairs. Spouse correlations showed increasing patterns with age. Parents-offspring correlations showed little variation with age, suggesting that the observed correlations with CVD risk factors were primarily due to genetic influences rather than environmental effects. Estimated heritabilities were 26% for BMI, 26% for high serum cholesterol, 19% for SBP, and 9% for DBP.

Unlike more conventional 'local median' methods, which are in effect based on locally fitting a polynomial of degree 0, techniques founded on local least absolute deviations have quadratic bias right up to the boundary of the design interval. Also in contrast to local least-squares methods based on linear fits, the order of magnitude of variance does not depend on tail-weight of the error distribution. To make these points clear, we develop theory describing local applications to time series of both least-squares and least-absolute-deviations methods, showing for example that, in the case of heavy-tailed data, the conventional local-linear least-squares estimator suffers from an additional bias term as well as increased variance."

To determine whether temperature and haematocrit (Hct) alter the relationship between blood flow (BF) and blood flow velocity (BFV). Methods. Using a transcranial Doppler apparatus, we measured the peak velocity of whole blood cells pumped by a cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit, through a 0.15-cm internal diameter segment of rigid tubing. BF and BFV relationships were obtained at temperatures of 19, 28, and 37°C and at Hct of 0.05, 0.22, 0.39, and 0.54, by altering CPB flow over a range from 10 to 100 cc/min. Linear regression analysis was performed. Results. The relationship between velocity and flow for the pooled Hct data was y=(0.43)x+0.86, r2=0.998 and 95% CI (0.999-I) whereas the association for the temperature data was y=(0.42)x+0.02, r2=0.9998 and 95% CI (0.999-0.9997). Changes of blood viscosity had no effect on velocity at a given flow rate. The combined effect of Hct and temperature on velocity for the relationship with flow is expressed by: y=1.3+2.4x. Conclusion. In fixed diameter vessels with laminar flow, the linear relationship between flow and velocity is not affected by changes in temperature and Hct in clinical ranges. These results are explained by the Fahraeus-Lindquist effect. They support the use of transcranial Doppler sonography to estimate cerebral blood flow in infants who may have large variations of Hct and/or temperature during bypass."

The aim of this experiment was to determine whether the ultrasound speed measured in the surface 3-5 mm of the midshaft dorsal cortex of MC3 could be related directly to the midshaft shape and size of the MC3s of young Thoroughbred racehorses at the same stage of training. Sixteen 2-year-old and sixteen 3 to 6-year-old racehorses, exercising at racing speed at the same training stable, had their ultrasound speed measured and were radiographed to measure their MC3 midshaft size (width of DC) and shape ([DC/palmar cortex] x [[DC+palmar cortex]/medulla widths]). There were significant linear relationships between ultrasound speed and radiographic bone size and shape measurements. The faster ultrasound speeds were associated with bones that were both absolutely and proportionately thinner in the dorsal cortex in both groups of racehorses. The measurement of ultrasound speed with the Sunlight Omnisense machine should allow more detailed and accurate predictions to be made for responses of the bone to exercise in the midshaft of MC3 than is possible using radiographic size and shape measurements alone.

To provide a nonradioactive immunoassay, we established an assay using nAChRs labeled with Eu3+-α-cobratoxin (α-CTx). Methods: We derivatized α-CTx with a diethylenetriaminepentaacetate moiety and formed a complex with Eu3+. The complex was purified by HPLC, and the fractions were tested for binding to Torpedo and human nAChRs. The most active fractions were used to label nAChRs for the immunoprecipitation assay, and the bound Eu3+ was quantified by time-resolved fluorescence. Results: Eu3+-labeled α-CTx competed with 125I-α-BuTx for binding to Torpedo nAChRs and saturated the binding sites of human nAChRs, with a Kd of 7.2 x 10-9 mol/L. Results of the immunoassay performed with Eu3+-labeled α-CTx were similar to those obtained with 125I-α-BuTx, with a slightly higher limit of detection [0.3 nmol/L (n = 6) vs ∼0.1 nmol/L for isotopic assay]. None of 34 negative sera tested (16 healthy controls, 10 patients with nonmyasthenia-related disease, 8 patients seronegative for MG) gave a value >0.3 nmol/L. Of the 35 positive myasthenic sera (with antibody values, previously determined by isotopic assay, of 0.4-1290 nmol/L) compared in the two assays, 32 tested positive with the Eu3+ assay. Linear regression analysis yielded the equation: y = 1.035x - 0.013 nmol/L; Sy/x = 0.172 nmol/L; r2 = 0.977.

Methods and Results: We measured cardiac noradrenaline spillover at rest by a radiotracer technique and V̇O2 peak, during cycle ergometry, by open circuit spirometry in 49 heart failure patients (mean age 54·4 ± 1-4 (SE)). There was a significant relationship between age and peak V̇O2 (P=0̇022), There was no significant relationship between cardiac noradrenaline spillover and either absolute or relative V̇O2 peak (P=0·136), with age included in a multiple linear regression model, and none between cardiac noradrenaline spillover and the percent predicted V̇O2, peak achieved (P=0·34).

Methods: A NIRS optode (containing an emitter and a receiver of near-infrared light) was placed directly below the right costal arch above the palpable liver in 40 children aged 0.02 to 7.28 yr (median: 1.8 yr). Spatially resolved spectroscopic measured tissue oxygenation index (TOI) was recorded using the NIRO-300™. Paired blood samples from the hepatic vein were taken under radiological control for determination of SvhO2 in a co-oxymeter. TOI values were compared with hepatic vein oxygenation, with simultaneously obtained arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), inferior vena java SO2 and hemoglobin concentration using simple linear and multi-regression analysis. Results: TOI values ranged from 35% to 73% (58.6 ± 8.4%); SvhO2 from 32% to 80% (58.4 ± 14.4%), and arterial SO2 from 54% to 100% (90.0 ± 11.4%). TOI and hepatic vein oxygen saturation failed to correlate (r = 0.052/P = 0.752). A regression model containing arterial saturation (ΔR2 = 0. 177) and the ratio of pulmonary to systemic resistance (ΔR2 = 0.095) explained 27.3% of the observed variance in TOI. In this model, hepatic vein oxygen saturation was no longer significant; explaining only 3.4% of the variance. No other variable retained a significant association. Conclusion: Transcutaneously measured NIRS tissue oxygenation with an optode placed over the palpable liver does not correlate with SvhO2. The value is dominated by non-hepatic variables such as arterial saturation and vascular resistances."

In mechanically ventilated patients the expiratory time constant provides information about respiratory mechanics. In the present study a new method, fuzzy clustering, is proposed to determine expiratory time constants. Fuzzy clustering differs from other methods since it neither interferes with expiration nor presumes any functional relationship between the variables analysed. Furthermore, time constant behaviour during expiration can be assessed, instead of an average time constant. The time constants obtained with fuzzy clustering are compared to time constants conventionally calculated from the same expirations. Methods. 20 mechanically ventilated patients, including 10 patients with COPD, were studied. The data of flow, volume and pressure were sampled. From these data, four local linear models were detected by fuzzy clustering. The time constants (τ) of the local linear models (clusters) were calculated by a least-squares technique. Time constant behaviour was analysed. Time constants obtained with fuzzy clustering were compared to time constants calculated from flow-volume curves using a conventional method. Results. Fuzzy clustering revealed two patterns of expiratory time constant behaviour. In the patients with COPD an initial low time constant was found (mean τ1: 0.33 s, SD 0.21) followed by higher time constants; mean τ2: 2.00 s (SD 0.91s), mean τ3: 3.45 s (SD 1.44) and mean τ4: 5.47 s (SD 2.93). In the other patients only minor changes in time constants were found; mean τ1: 0.74 s (SD 0.30), mean τ2: 0.90 s (SD 0.23), mean τ3: 1.04 s (SD 0.42) and mean τ4: 1.74 s (SD 0.78). Both the pattern of expiratory time constants, as well as the time constants calculated from the separate clusters, were significantly different between the patients with and without COPD. Time constants obtained with fuzzy clustering for cluster 2, 3 and 4 correlated well with time constants obtained from the flow-volume curves. Conclusions. In mechanically ventilated patients, expiratory time constant behaviour can be accurately assessed by fuzzy clustering. A good correlation was found between time constants obtained with fuzzy clustering and time constants obtained by conventional analysis. On the basis of the time constants obtained with fuzzy clustering, a clear distinction was made between patients with and without COPD."

While cognitive information is available from the speedometer, motorists probably rely more heavily upon extra-vehicle visual information. How is this accomplished in poor visibility conditions? Consistent with evidence that perceived speed decreases with reduced contrast, Snowden et al. (Nature, 1998) found that drivers underestimate their speed when operating a simulator in foggy conditions. The present study investigated whether this hazardous misperception and unintentional increase in speed also occur when driving an automobile on a rural public road. With the speedometer obstructed from view, 14 participants (mean age 35.79 yrs) drove around a closed road circuit three times under each of three randomly ordered visual conditions: clear view and two levels of reduced contrast (created by diffusing plastic filters on the windscreen and side windows). Dependent measures, collected on separate laps at 7 locations along the circuit, were: Verbal Estimates of speed; Adjustment of Speed to instructed levels (25 to 70 km/h); and Judgments of Minimum Stopping Distance (before colliding with a model wallaby). Actual speed was recorded at each judgment. All measures of perceived speed decreased significantly with reduced visibility: Travel Speed (58 to 49 km/h, F(2,13)=24.3; p<.0001); Verbal Estimates (50 to 44 km/h, F(2,13=7.95; p<.02); Minimum Stopping Distance (17.9m to 129.5m, F(2,88) 13.84 p<.0001). Linear regressions showed that speed adjustments were highly correlated with the target instructions (r2=0.95 to 0.96), with slopes declining from 0.91 to 0.80 with reduced contrast. These findings demonstrate that drivers travel more slowly in fog, and they estimate their speed with equal reliability, under clear and foggy conditions. Moreover, unlike laboratory findings, speed adjustment data revealed a tendency to overestimate speed in the fog."

This linear combination of variables plays an important role when one tries to fit a hyperplane to a cloud of points. In data analysis, variables are often subject to a linear transformation. The results that we provide here take account of such a transformation. Firstly, we define a 'distance' between a variable and a set U of variables. Among the linear combinations of the variables in U, the last principal component is the most 'distant' from U. Secondly, we clarify the link between the last principal component and (i) linear dependence, (ii) equation of an optimal hyperplane, and (iii) invariance of the optimal hyperplane under linear transformation of the variables. Finally, we show how the decomposition formula of inertia of a hyperplane in principal component analysis and the decomposition formula of the total sum of squares in linear regression both derive from a common principle. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Measurements and results: OCC and LCFI methods were performed using the same ventilator, which had been specifically implemented for this purpose. LCFI of 5, 10, and 15 l/min and OCC were applied in a random order at zero end-expiratory positive pressure. Airway pressure was measured both proximal (Pao) and distal (Ptr) to the endotracheal tube. Lower inflection point (LIP) and maximal slope (Cmax, rs) were estimated using unbiased iterative linear regressions. LIPrs was obtained in all patients under LCFI and in nine patients under OCC.

Only the mean values of LIPrs for Pao with LCFI at 15 l/min were significantly different from those obtained for OCC. The Cmax, rs values found with the two methods were similar. Conclusions: An LCFI less than or equal to 10 l/min seems to be a quick, safe, and reliable method to determine LIPrs and Cmax, rs at the bedside."

Graham &Nachmias (1972) found minimal subthreshold summation of a 1st plus 3rd harmonic, strongly supporting a multiple channel model against an ideal observer template model. However there is mounting evidence for a template model in the suprathreshold regime. We repeated their experiment in the presence of noise with the goals of determining: (i) the observer's template, (ii) whether an ideal observer or a multiple channel model was operating for these suprathreshold stimuli, and (iii) the ratio of internal systematic vs. random noise. Methods. The noise was the sum of 1st through 7th harmonics of a 1 c/deg grating. Six cosine test patterns were used consisting of the 2nd, 6th, and four combinations of the 2nd and 6th harmonics. We used the method of constant stimuli with 4 test contrasts and 4 responses. A classification template was obtained by linear regression of the responses on the cosine noise amplitudes. Each run was repeated (double pass) to measure the ratio of systematic vs. random noise. A second method for measuring this ratio is based on the d' ratio of the human observer to a template observer (predicted ideal response to the stimulus using the classification template). Results &Discussion. We found that some templates can be formed efficiently, improving results beyond that of the multiple channel prediction by Graham &Nachmias. This provides evidence for a template observer in suprathreshold detection tasks. However, the fact that this was not found in all cases suggests that observers had difficulty creating an efficient classification template for some of the compound stimuli. The double pass analysis implied that internal systematic noise (mismatched template rather than random noise) was the main factor controlling thresholds."

Methods: Twenty-nine autologous greater saphenous vein-patched CEAs performed between 1983 and 1994 were examined with five to nine sequential duplex scans each that included B-mode measurements of both the common carotid bulb (CCB) and internal carotid bulb (ICB) diameters. A total of 186 scans of each of the two segments were performed from 2 to 182 months after CEA (mean, 64 months). The time from the first to the last scan ranged from 30 to 120 months (mean, 76 months). Repeated measures analysis of variance was used as a means of testing the relationship of CCB and ICB diameters with time from CEA and with time from the first scan. Simple linear regression was used as a means of analyzing the variability of individual CCB and ICB diameters and pooled normalized diameters in both time frames. Results: The CCB diameters ranged from 8.4 to 18.5 mm (mean, 13.1 mm), and the ICB diameters ranged from 6.4 to 16.0 mm (mean, 11.2 mm). No significant relationship between both CCB and ICB diameters in the time from CEA or the time from the first scan (P = .643 to .913), for sex (P = .403 to .917), or for early and late post-CEA time of study onset (P = .135 to .773) was shown by means of repeated measures analysis. Low R2 values (CCB mean, 0.17; ICB mean, 0.21) and non-significant P values for regression slope (CCB mean, 0.46; ICB mean, 0.54) were given by means of individual regression analysis. There was no correlation between individual regression coefficients and the mean diameters of the arteries. The mean change in CCB diameter was 0.023 mm/year (range, -0.37 to 0.30 mm/year), and the mean change in ICB diameter was -0.030 mm/year (range, -0.33 to 0.37 mm/year). Regression of normalized CCB and ICB diameters versus time gave R2 values less than 0.02 and slopes not statistically significantly different from zero. The predicted 10-year average percent change in normalized diameters ranged from 0.8% to 3.3%. Conclusion: In a 15-year period after CEA and a 10-year sequential B-mode scan study period, there was no evidence of significant enlargement of saphenous vein-patched CEAs. This is also true for CEAs in men and women and for subsets with larger and smaller CCB and ICB diameters and early and late scan onset times. Dilatation after saphenous vein patching is most likely a rare isolated event and not the result of generalized or frequent progressive enlargement.

The inclusion of correction fadtors (for glucose or plasmatic water) and of residual volume, and the use of 3 or 6 peritoneal samples were analyzed to discover the differences between programs. The main outcome measures were peritoneal permeability and adequacy parameters, evaluated by Student t-test (mean and paired comparisons) and linear regression for correlation. ◆ Results: No significant differences were found in D/P values for small solutes. At the first step, mass transfer area coefficient (MTAC) urea and MTAC creatinine were significantly higher in DP-A than in CP, but MTAC glucose did not differ. The causes of differences were: (1) inclusion of a correction factor for aqueous plasmatic concentration of small solutes in CP; (2) lack of inclusion of residual volume in peritoneal volumes in CP; and (3) use of 6 peritoneal samples in CP versus 3 in PD-A. At the second step, when the input data were made equivalent for both programs, the differences disappeared for MTAC urea, creatinine, and glucose (mean comparison), but creatinine and glucose remained different by paired comparison. Similar results were obtained when a correction for plasmatic aqueous concentration was applied to the data in both programs [MTAC urea: 22.60 ± 4.27 mL/min (CP) vs; 22.43 ± 4.61 mL/min (PD-A), nonsignificant, r=0.97; MTAC creatinine: 9.76 ± 3.83 mL/min (CP) vs 10.61 ± 3.07 mL/min (PD-A), nonsignificant, r= 0.98; MTAC glucose: 13.30 ± 3.12 mL/min (CP) vs 11.87 ± 3.41 mL/min (PD-A), nonsignificant, r=0.92]. Creatinine and glucose were different by paired Mest. No significant differences were found in Kt/V and urea generation rate. Weekly creatinine clearance [WCCr: 70.71±16.71 L (CP) versus 79.33±18.73 L (PD-A), p < 0.001] and creatinine generation rate [CrGR: 0.56 ± 0.18 mg/min (CP) versus 0.61±0.19 mg/min (PD-A), p < 0.001) were significantly higher in PD-A than in CP owing to the lack of creatinine correction according to glucose concentration in the PD-A adequacy program. Finally, normalized protein nitrogen appearance according to Bergström [1.09 ± 0.20 g/kg/d (CP) versus 1.03 ± 0.21 g/kg/d (PD-A), p = 0.01] was different owing to the different algorithms and normalization method: standardized body weight in CP and actual body weight in PD-A. ◆ Conclusions: Provided that equivalent data are used, PD-A and CP yield similar results. The PD-A program needs external correction of data input: (1) for plasmatic water concentration in MTAC calculations, and (2) for peritoneal glucose interference with creatinine analysis (Jaffé method) in WCCr and CrGR calculations; otherwise, it may give falsely optimistic results."

Methods: Four different oral doses of enalapril maleate (2.5, 5, 10 and 20 mg) were administered to six healthy normotensive volunteers, in a four-period crossover study. Serum ACE inhibition profiles were determined in each case using a synthetic substrate, hippuryl-histidyl-leucine (HHL). Pharmacodynamic parameters of the drug (Emax and AUEC0→24) were calculated and their relationship to oral doses investigated using linear regression analysis. Results: There was no significant relationship between drug dose and the two pharmacodynamic parameters (Emax and AUEC0→24). The r2 values were 0.548 (F = 3.63, P = 0.153) and 0.6360 (F = 5.24, P = 0.106) for Emax and AUEC0→24, respectively. Conclusion: The extent of serum ACE inhibition, as the main determinant of the blood pressure lowering effect of enalapril, is not dose-dependent within the single dose range of 2.5-20 mg."

A 5-FG conductance catheter was placed within a latex balloon and positioned in the RV cavity of seven freshly excised porcine hearts. Conductance was recorded while saline was withdrawn from the intraventricular balloon in 2 mi decrements. Linear regression analysis of measured conductance versus reference volumes was computed. The effect of left ventricular (LV) filling and catheter length on conductance derived RV volume was also determined. Conductance derived volumes were highly correlated with reference volumes [R2 0.976, standard deviation (SD) 0.035]. The mean gradient of regression was 0.97 (SD 0.10), and it was not significantly affected by LV volume alterations. However, when we analyzed LV filling, a small but significant increase in the y-intercept was observed (LV empty 3.11 ml, SD 1.71; LV full 4.58, SD 2.39; p = 0.008). Introduction of the catheter through either the tricuspid or pulmonary orifices were both effective in ventricular volume measurement. The effect of mismatch between the catheter length and the RV long axis dimension was evaluated by changing the position of the active sensing electrodes along the catheter body. Conductance measurements, obtained from catheters shorter than the long axis of the RV, still maintained a highly linear correlation with real volume, but regression gradients were significantly reduced (long 0.975, SD 0.087; medium 0.787, SD 0.094; small 0.589, SD 0.091; p < 0.001). These results show that a conductance catheter of appropriate length can accurately measure RV volume, despite the complex shape and geometric changes associated with ventricular filling."

In this study, a prototype confocal instrument was evaluated in which a photon counting photomultiplier tube (PMT) detector was added to provide faster and more quantitative measurements, while still maintaining the imaging capability of the microscope. To acquire images and measure backscattered light simultaneously, an uncoated pellicle beam splitter was incorporated into the light path of the confocal microscope. This beam splitter reflects 8% of the confocal signal to the PMT. The CMTF scans were performed on four rabbits using the prototype instrument. Corneal images and 3-D reconstructions acquired with and without the beam splitter in the light path appeared identical. Both the camera and PMT CMTF curves had easily identifiable peaks corresponding to the epithelium, basal lamina, and endothelium. No significant differences were found between PMT and camera CMTF measurements of epithelial, stromal, or corneal thickness (n=12 scans). Furthermore, a high correlation was found between camera and PMT measurements (linear regression analysis, y=0.999×-0.4, r=0.99, p<0.001). The data suggest that by adding a pellicle beam splitter, CMTF intensity data can be acquired using a PMT. The PMT has a faster sampling rate and greater dynamic range than the camera and provides a count of the photons detected. Thus, the instrument has the potential for improving corneal pachymetry and backscattering measurements while still providing high-resolution corneal images."

Methods: A mathematical model was used to describe variations in gas fractions, alveolar volume, and gas exchange in the pulmonary capillaries during the breathing cycle. Experimental data were obtained from 17 healthy subjects at rest and during exercise at 40, 50, 65, and 75% V̇O2max on a cycle ergometer. VȮ2, V̇CO2, and PET.CO2 were monitored continuously with a MedGraphics CPX/D gas exchange system. Arterial gases were measured in brachial artery blood samples drawn simultaneously with gas exchange. Cardiac output was measured using the CO2 rebreathing method corrected by the arterial blood sample data. The model parameters including cardiac output, end-expiratory alveolar volume, and mixed-venous gas contents were estimated by fitting model V̇CO2 to experimental values over 50 breaths. Results: The fit of model parameters gave arterial gas partial pressures not significantly different from measured data. Measured Pa.CO2 and Pa.O2 were significantly correlated with model outputs (R2 = 0.991 for Pa.CO2 and R2 = 0.999 for Pa.O2; P < 0.0001). The cardiac output values estimated using the breathing lung model were significantly correlated with the values obtained with the corrected CO2 rebreathing method (R2 = 0.71; P < 0.0001). There was, however, a significant 2.3 L.min-1 difference between these two methods. Conclusion: Results obtained with the proposed method were in good agreement with measured arterial gas partial pressures.

Despite of this strong undershooting of depth extents, many other studies were concerned with a source of information for depth perception that may work for more accurate judgments, known as motion parallax. The present study is concerned with the effects of motion parallax on spatial anisotropy of exocentric distances in distal layouts. We introduced four types of head movements, free, restrained (control groups), translational, and rotational head movements, in order to investigate that issue, and two viewing conditions, monocular and binocular, for scrutinize interactions between motion parallax and binocular disparity. Observers verbally estimated exocentric distances from a layout composed of two dimensions, saggital and frontoparallel, whose center of expansion was lo0cated 49.213 ft (15 m) away the observation point. Repeated measures ANOVA over verbal estimates showed that depth extents were strongly undershot and frontoparallel extents were slightly undershot, F(1, 36)=109.240, p=.000 (control groups), even with induced motion parallax, F(1, 36)=35.312, p=.000 (translational and rotational). No effects were found for binocular disparity, F>1. We also submitted data on linear regression analysis (D' = b + aD), matching depth and frontoparallel estimates. Perfect fit was only obtained for translational head movement under monocular viewing, t(9)=.541, p=.602. Our results indicated that motion parallax produced by translational head movement is a powerful cue for depth in large outdoors spaces, even though we found that spatial anisotropy remains a strong perceptual phenomenon. Our data also indicated that motion parallax is a strong cue for frontoparallel extents when produced by rotational head movement."

In this work, we focus on the features fitted to a linear regression-based speaker adaptation. These are obtained by feature transformation based on independent component analysis (ICA), and the feature transformation matrices are estimated from the training data and adaptation data. Since the adaptation data is not sufficient to reliably estimate the ICA-based feature transformation matrix, it is necessary to adjust the ICA-based feature transformation matrix estimated from a new speaker utterance. To cope with this problem, we propose a smoothing method through a linear interpolation between the speaker-independent (SI) feature transformation matrix and the speaker-dependent (SD) feature transformation matrix. From our experiments, we observed that the proposed method is more effective in the mismatched case. In the mismatched case, the adaptation performance is improved because the smoothed feature transformation matrix makes speaker adaptation using noisy speech more robust."

This fact makes application of multivariate linear model analysis difficult, except if a reduction of the data matrix dimension is performed prior to the analysis.

This problem has not been adequately discussed in the literature concerning multivariate linear analysis of brain imaging data. No theoretical foundation has been given to support that the null distributions of the tests are as claimed. Our study addresses this issue by introducing a method of constructing test statistics that follow the same distributions as when the data matrix is normally distributed. The method is based on the invariance of certain tests over a large class of distributions of the data matrix. This implies that the method is very general and can be applied for different reductions of the data matrix. As an illustration we apply a test statistic constructed by the method now presented to test a multivariate hypothesis on a PET data set. The test rejects the null hypothesis of no significant differences in measured brain activity between two conditions. The effect responsible for the rejection of the hypothesis is characterized using canonical variate analysis (CVA) and compared with the result obtained by using univariate regression analysis for each voxel and statistical inference based on size of activations. The results obtained from CVA and the univariate method are similar. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

The 'tau- dot' variable, the first temporal derivative of the current time-to-contact, was suggested to play a critical role in the prospective control of deceleration (e.g. Lee, 1976; Yilmaz & Warren, 1995). Lane changing can be considered as a biphasic task, where in a first phase a lateral velocity is produced (pull-out), which then has to be minimized in a second phase (approach to the envisaged lane). This second alignment phase necessarily requires prospective control of the lateral deceleration. Here we asked, whether lane changing might be guided by tau-dot, resulting in a lateral approach to the new lane with tau-dot values kept constant at or regulated around -0.5. In a driving simulation using a large cylindrical projection screen (7m diameter), 46 participants were asked to drive in a 3.5 m wide straight lane and to perform consecutive lane changes to an adjacent lane. The deceleration of 1460 trajectories of the second phase were analyzed, computing fit and slope of a linear regression of time-to-contact with respect to time. We found that two-thirds of the lane changes can be described by a single tau-dot value (criterion r > 0.6, mean r = 0.94). These trials yield a mean tau-dot of -0.499 (sd = 0.132), which is in suprising agreement with the theoretical value of -0.5. Futhermore, we observed also a positive correlation (r = 0.68) between the time required for the completion of the lane change and the tau-dot values. Our results complement previous studies showing evidence for the use of the tau-dot variable, even when the point of termination of the approach was largely self-defined, as it was true for our task. Drivers prefered a path with a constant lateral deceleration, despite the non-linear relationship between lateral deceleration and steering-wheel amplitude."

This is obtained by spatio-temporal integration of digital Doppler velocity profile data. Objective: To evaluate the use of the ACM method in the non-invasive assessment of aortic regurgitant volume and per cent regurgitant fraction (%RF) in patients with aortic regurgitation. Methods: Aortic outflow volume and mitral inflow volume were calculated by the ACM method in 22 patients with isolated aortic regurgitation. Aortic regurgitant volume and %RF were calculated using the following equations: aortic regurgitant volume = [aortic outflow volume] - [mitral inflow volume]; %RF = [aortic regurgitant volume]/[aortic outflow volume] x 100. The results were compared with those obtained using pulsed Doppler cross sectional echocardiography (PD-2D). Results: Aortic regurgitant volumes measured by the ACM method showed a good correlation with the PD-2D measurements (r = 0.95, y = 0.9x + 3.9, SEE = 8.6 ml); the mean (SD) difference between the two methods was -1.5 (8.5) mi. %RF estimated by the ACM method also correlated well with the values obtained by the PD-2D method (r = 0.91, y = 0.9x + 4.9, SEE = 6.0%); the mean difference between the two methods was - 1.5 (6.0)%. Total time required for aortic regurgitant volume (for one cardiac cycle) by the ACM method was significantly shorter than by the PD-2D method (130 (16) v 230 (32) s, p < 0.01). Conclusions: The newly developed the ACM method is quick and accurate in the automated assessment of aortic regurgitant volume and per cent regurgitant fraction in patients with isolated aortic regurgitation."

The purpose of the present study was to develop and test a population-specific formula predicting average creatinine excretion in CPD. ◆ Methods: Creatinine excretion in urine plus dialysate was measured in 925 CPD patients. Forty patients were excluded because of evidence of noncompliance. The remaining 885 subjects were randomly grouped into a derivation group (n = 432) and a validation group (n = 453). Stepwise multiple linear regression models were used to predict creatinine excretion in the derivation group. The candidate variables, chosen because they were previously shown to be predictors of creatinine excretion in CPD, included weight (W), age (A), gender (G), diabetes (D), and interaction terms between these four variables. Estimates of creatinine excretion from the best-fit regression formula (CrExcr1) and from the Cockroft-Gault formula (CrExcr2) were compared to creatinine excretion (CrExcr) in the validation group. ◆ Results: The best-fit regression model in the derivation group included all four candidate variables (W, A, G, D), but no interaction terms. This model was as follows: CrExcr1 = 302.150 - 4.380A + 171.234G - 39.041D + 11.730W (r2 = 0.477, p < 0.001). In the validation set, CrExcr = -15.795 + 0.988CrExcr1 (r2 = 0.447, p < 0.001), and CrExcr = -303.823 + 0.732CrExcr2 (r2 = 0.340, p < 0.001). When the differences between measured and predicted creatinine excretion did not take into account the sign of each individual difference, CrExcr -CrExcr1 = 201 ± 156 mg/24 hours, and CrExcr -CrExcr2 = 235 ± 174 mg/24 hr (p < 0.001) in the validation group. When the sign of the difference was taken into account, CrExcr - CrExcr1 = -28 ± 149 mg/24 hr, and CrExcr - CrExcr2 = 63 ± 295 mg/24 hr (p < 0.001). ◆ Conclusions: A population-specific formula predicting creatinine excretion in CPD was derived. This formula has greater accuracy than the Cockroft-Gault formula and can be used in studies of creatinine excretion in CPD."

The most dorsal aspects of area 7a and dorsal prelunate (DP) were imaged. Recordings were made in the right hemisphere of a macaque trained to fixate a 0.1° red dot and perform a cued detection task. Two 10° expanding optic flow stimuli were simultaneously presented 10° to the left and right (or above and below) the target. The monkey responded to a change in the structure of one of the two stimuli. A 2° white cue instructed the monkey as to which stimulus would change. A behavioral catch-trial control was also used for which the cue was incorrect. Behaviorally, there was a decrease in the reaction time of 25-50 msec when the monkey was correctly vs. incorrectly cued indicating a spatial attentional shift. The evoked optical response across the posterior parietal cortex depended on the locus of attention with the appearance of columns corresponding to the location of the attentional cue. We quantified these effects using a linear regression analysis. The columns were seen in all the experiments performed over 10 months and had the same dimension in both horizontal and vertical paradigm. These attentional columns were not seen in controls when just the cue was presented and the animal attended only to the central fixation point. For verification, multi-unit recordings were made using both the attentional task and the control task. The great majority of neurons showed no dependence at the onset of the stimuli upon the cue condition. A control paradigm in which the animal had to detect a central fixation point dimming showed that the cue alone had little or no effect on the firing rate. Thus the observed columns are not likely to result from the cue stimuli, but rather the spatial focus of the attention. The columns represent a novel functional architecture correlated with attention."

Forty-eight pregnant women (threatened miscarriage and premature labor, 39; pre-eclampsia, 3; hyperemesis, 3; ileus, 2; bleeding from the colon, 1) and 19 non-pregnant women admitted in Kobe University Hospital were enrolled in this study. Blood samples of normal pregnant controls were also obtained from 172 healthy pregnant women attending the outpatient clinic. Serum IGF-I levels and nitrogen balance were measured serially in 9 pregnant women with threatened miscarriage and premature labor and 9 malnourished pregnant women out of 48 pregnant women. Serum IGF-I and urinary nitrogen levels were measured by radioimmunoassay with acid-ethanol extraction and the Dumas method, respectively. Nitrogen balance was expressed as the difference between daily nitrogen intake and nitrogen excretion assessed by urinary nitrogen levels. Serum IGF-I levels in normal pregnant controls significantly increased in the third trimester of pregnancy compared with non-pregnant controls. No difference in serum IGF-I levels in any trimester of pregnancy was observed between normal pregnant controls and pregnant women with threatened miscarriage and premature labor. There was no significant difference in nitrogen balance between the pregnant women with threatened miscarriage and premature labor and non-pregnant controls. In the longitudinal study, no correlation was found between the changes in serum IGF-I levels and those in nitrogen balance in the 9 pregnant women with threatened premature labor (daily nitrogen balance > 0 g/day) on the basis of linear regression analysis. On the other hand, the changes in serum IGF-I levels in the 9 malnourished pregnant women were significantly correlated with those in nitrogen balance (y = 1.72x + 17.5; r = 0.60; P<0.05: linear regression analysis). These results indicate that maternal nutritional states have a major effect on serum IGF-I levels in malnourished pregnant women, but not in pregnant women with daily nitrogen balance > 0 g/day. Serum IGF-I levels can be a potent index of nutritional states under malnutrition during human pregnancy."

The number of dams per maternal grandsire (MGS), however, could be large enough to contribute to QTL detection. But dams and MGS usually are not genotyped, there are two recombination opportunities between the MGS and the progeny, and at a given location, only half the progeny receive a MGS chromosomal segment. A 3-step procedure was developed to estimate: (1) the marker phenotypes probabilities of the MGS; (2) the probability of each possible MGS haplotype; (3) the probabilities that the progeny receives either the first, or second MGS segment, or a maternal grandam segment. These probabilities were used for QTL detection in a linear model including the effects of sire, MGS, paternal QTL, MGS QTL and maternal grandam QTL. Including the grandam QTL effect makes it possible to detect QTL in the grandam population, even when MGS are not informative. The detection power, studied by simulation, was rather high, provided that MGS family size was greater than 50. Using maternal information in the French dairy cattle granddaughter design made it possible to detect 23 additional QTL genomewise significant."

The statistical technique is based on a stepwise multiple linear regression using yearly accumulation as the predictand and the principle components (PCs) of seasonally averaged large-scale atmospheric fields as predictors. In order to separate the accumulation variations related to circulation and thermodynamics, the first step involves the stream-function field as the predictor. In the second step, temperature PCs are related to the residuals between real ice accumulation and accumulation described by stream-function PCs. One model is fitted for a North Greenland ice core. The atmospheric data are monthly NCEP Reanalysis data from 1948 to 1992. A statistical relationship is found which reproduces about 71.5% of local ice accumulation variability. The relationship involves 3 physically plausible stream-function patterns, representing a seasonal mean (May to August) over Greenland, the North Atlantic and North Europe, which describes 64% of variance. In the second step, an additional contribution of the temperature field to the explained variance of 7.5% is achieved.

On the study days the subjects were orally water loaded to achieve a state of overhydration with a high urine flow rate. When a steady-state diuresis was achieved after approximately 2 h, 0.396 μg of desmopressin was administered intravenously as a bolus injection.

Methods: In five practices, 45 patients had their β-2-agonist and steroid inhalers exchanged for Ventolin and Flixotide Accuhalers™. They completed the Illness Perception Questionnaire, the Attitudes to Treatment for Asthma Questionnaire, and a self-report questionnaire at entry, after one month's run-in, and at three months. A nurse counted the number of doses used. Univariate analysis was performed with Accuhaler use over three months as the dependent variable. Independent variables included the questionnaire sub-scales and morbidity. Significant variables were entered into multiple linear regression. Results: The self-report questionnaire explained 40% of the variance of steroid use. The ATAQ relief sub-scale and morbidity explained 29% of the variance of β-2-agonist use. Conclusions: Steroid inhaler use can be partly predicted by self-reported behaviour and β-2-agonist use by attitudes to inhaler treatment. These findings have implications for patient education."

Materials and methods: The study included 734 consecutive patients (366 males and 368 females) in whom acute appendicitis was clinically suspected and evaluated using HRUS between January 1997 and November 1999. Patients were classified into two groups by sex, and further classified into four age groups (I = 0-17 yr; II = 18-45 yr; III = 46-60 yr; IV = > 60 yr) for categorical analysis. We retrospectively reviewed and compared the patients' HRUS images with their operative findings and histologic results to evaluate the overall age-specific and sex-specific diagnostic ability of HRUS for acute appendicitis. The chi-square test was used for categorical data analysis. Comparative analysis of our data with previously published data on the correlation between the prevalence of acute appendicitis and sonographic diagnosis of acute appendicitis was performed using linear regression. Results: The overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive rates were 89%, 87%, 90%, 89% and 88%, respectively. Age-specific analysis revealed a statistically significant difference in diagnostic accuracy between age groups II and III among women (85% vs 96%, respectively; p < 0.05). Sex-specific analysis of age group II showed higher sensitivity (90% vs 77%; p < 0.05) and positive predictive values (89% vs 77%; p < 0.05) in women than in men, respectively. In age group III, the accuracy of HRUS was higher in men than in women (96% vs 84%, respectively; p < 0.05). The negative predictive value and overall diagnostic accuracy were negatively correlated to the prevalence of acute appendicitis. Conclusion: The value of HRUS for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis varied among different age and sex groups. The prevalence of acute appendicitis was negatively correlated with the negative predictive value and overall diagnostic accuracy of HRUS for acute appendicitis."

Between September and November 1998, seven measurements of distance among dewclaw, hip, hock, pinbone, and thurl were taken on 73 cows from the University of Illinois dairy farm. Measurements were combined to define triangles and therefore angles reflecting rear leg structure. Three novice evaluators participated in the experiment, and, on a given day, two sets of measurements were taken by two evaluators. Cows were measured twice at a 1- to 4-wk interval. Size, evaluator, and order of measurement were included in the model as fixed effects. Cow, interactions of cow x evaluator and cow x order of measurement were random effects included in the model. The model explained over 80% of the variation for each variable. Repeatability estimates of the length measurements ranged from 0.61 to 0.89. Repeatability estimates of angles were much lower ranging from 0.00 to 0.24. The variation in natural standing position of the cow hampered the accuracy of the objective measurements. Low estimates of repeatability for angles describing rear leg suggested that objective measurements by novice evaluators were not sufficiently reliable to potentially replace the subjective linear score for rear leg curvature determined by experts. Usefulness of further investigation to find objective measurements that would give a better description of rear legs conformation compared to the corresponding current type trait was questionable."

Method: Reading performance was assessed using the Pepper Test, an oral test of random letters and words. The test was scored for speed and accuracy (corrected reading rate [CRR]= total number items correct/time). Mean acuity reserve was 0.25 log units. Subjects also completed an extensive battery of vision tests. Results: Not surprisingly, significant differences were obtained between elders with reduced vs. good acuity. The reduced acuity group was older (mean age= 81.8 vs. 72.8 yrs) and slower on the Pepper Test (CRR= 57.6 vs. 91.0 words per minute). Multiple linear regression revealed that contrast sensitivity, as well as low contrast acuity in glare, and gross motor ability were significant independent predictors of reading performance in the reduced acuity group, accounting for 44% of the variability. Our prior findings in those with good acuity indicated that low contrast/low luminance acuity, high contrast acuity, gross motor ability, impact of lighting changes on walking, and impact of divided attention on visual field size were all significant independent predictors of reading ability. These factors accounted for 36% of the variability in Pepper reading task performance. Conclusions: For older individuals with good or reduced acuity, once other factors are taken into account, age is no longer a significant independent predictor of reading performance. However, for the reduced acuity group, fewer factors are required to account for variability in reading performance. In both groups, we find substantial variation in reading performance that isn't accounted for by standard high contrast acuity, emphasizing the importance of assessing reading ability in older adults."

The aim of this study was to examine the relation between cardiac haemodynamics and parameters extracted from the intracardiac electrogram obtained during pacing, i.e. ventricular evoked response. Methods and results. In the course of routinely scheduled right heart catheterization, intracardiac electrograms and cardiac haemodynamics were monitored simultaneously in ten heart transplant patients (two females, aged 48 ± 12 (18-59) years), using pacemaker telemetry and Swan-Ganz thermodilution techniques. Different haemodynamic states were induced by pacemaker programming (pacing rate changes) and table tilting (postural changes). Forty different haemodynamic states were assessed, with an average of three (2-4) haemodynamic variations in each patient. Linear regression analysis between relative stroke volume changes and relative changes in the R wave slew rate as extracted from the evoked responses revealed a strong, inverse, and highly significant correlation (r= - 0.93, P<0.0001) between those parameters. Similar results were obtained for pacing rate and postural variations alone, respectively. Conclusions. The strong correlation between changes in stroke volume and R slew rate indicates that paced intracardiac electrograms reflect changes in the size and geometry of the heart. Telemetrically recorded intracardiac electrograms may thus be used non-invasively to assess key aspects of cardiac haemodynamics. © 2002 The European Society of Cardiology.

However, they all involved use of ring averages across the retinal field. Purpose: To estimate the age-related changes in the localized response and retinal topography using point-to-point comparison. To determine the localized variability in the mfERG scalar product across age and the topography of the age-related change. Methods: MfERG recordings of 71 normal phakic subjects (ages 9-80) were analyzed with VERIS TM 4.8. The stimulus parameters were: 103 hexagons, 75 Hz frame rate, peak luminance 200 cd/m2, m= 2 14. Scalar products (for each hexagon based on ring average templates) were obtained and analyzed for age-related changes. Statistical measures (coefficient of variation (CV) and parameters of a linear regression model) were applied. Point-by-point comparison for hemifields was performed. Results: Each localized response showed a significant aging effect. The average decline of the response for all hexagons was ∼15%/decade varying from 3.3% (peripherally) to 7.5% (perifoveally). The average CV for all subjects at all locations was 29.4% (± 4.1%). The CV distribution was relatively homogenous across the retina except for a small region around the optic disc (4 hexagons), which was excluded from further analysis. Topographical maps of the parameters of the linear regression model showed a distribution that was different from the topography of the ring averages. The rate of change was significantly higher for the superior then for the inferior retina, but no naso-temporal asymmetry with age was found. Conclusions: Our data for CV are consistent with the data previously reported for samples with a more restricted age range. Information about change of individual hexagons with age should make the mfERG more useful in quantitatively monitoring progression of retinal disease."

Many reports of regression equations for PEF by country and ethnicity are prepared using Wright or mini-Wright PEF meters, which have been calibrated by human subjects. Yet, no study has been performed in any country to determine the reference values of PEF on the American Thoracic Society (ATS) scale, which is calibrated by a computer-driven mechanical pump. Methods: Peak expiratory flow was measured with mini-Wright meters calibrated on the Wright scale. All subjects were taught how to perform a forced expiratory maneuver: the highest of three PEF values was recorded and standing height was measured. The Miles equation was used to convert mini-Wright PEF values (traditional scale) to values using the new 'mechanical' PEF, which the ATS has recommended (ATS scale). In the analysis of the data, a model based on age, age squared and age cubed was used to derive curvilinear regression equations for PEF on age and standing height for each sex. Results: There was adequate representation of subjects of each sex at all ages to 74 years. Curves plotted from the regression equations rose during adolescence and early adulthood, reached maximum values at 35 years in males and 40 years in females and then declined in an approximately linear manner. For both sexes, standing height fell progressively with increasing age. Conclusions: From the regression equations, predicted values of PEF can be derived for any Japanese adult aged 15-74 years. We were able to obtain predicted equations for PEF in normal Japanese adults using both the Wright and ATS scales. Direct comparison of our regressions with those reported in other populations was limited by differences in methodology and analysis. In comparable studies of Chinese and Indian populations, the PEF values in those studies were appreciably lower than ours. Our regressions were remarkably similar to those reported in a study of British subjects that used virtually identical entry criteria and methods."

The incubation study was conducted in cylinders placed in microplots (no plants were grown in cylinders), and the rest of each microplot was sowed with the wheat crop (Triticum durum var. Massa). N mineralisation and immobilisation depend on the presence or the absence of wheat residues. In absence of residues, a linear model of regression was developed to follow the clear nitrogen mineralisation at different soil levels. Nitrogen mineralisation (mg kg-1), during the five months of wheat development, showed the following decreasing order: 0-15 cm (132.6) > 15-30 cm (120.6) > 30-45 cm (91.3). The mineralisation rate was 24.1,22.9 and 18.9 mg kg-1 d-1 for 0-15, 15-30 and 30-45 cm levels, respectively. The supply of wheat residues resulted in a five months N immobilisation process. At level 0-15 cm the immobilisation (mg kg-1) showed the following decreasing order: (61.6) > (46.4) > (30.0) for the supply of wheat residues at seeding time, and 15 and 30 d before seeding respectively. At the other levels, the same decreasing order was recorded. The supply of 8 t ha-1 of wheat residues at seeding time, and 15 or 30 d before seeding, decreased the dry matter yield and N accumulation in wheat crop. In consequence, there was no synchronism between the nitrogen liberated by wheat residues decomposition and the wheat growth. © 2002 Académie des sciences / éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS."
